Password Safe is a password manager.
It stores your passwords in an encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "master password"), instead of all the username/password combinations that you use.
For extra security, you can use a Yubikey device to provide two-factor authentication.

Password Safe runs on Windows, Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.
