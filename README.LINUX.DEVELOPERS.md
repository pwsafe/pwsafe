## Introduction
PasswordSafe is being ported to Linux using the wxWidgets user
interface library. Following are notes for programmers wishing to
build the Linux version. Currently, PasswordSafe is being built on
Debian-based platforms (Debian and Ubuntu), and Fedora, so
requirements are described in terms of .deb and .rpm packages.


## Source Code
The source code can be downloaded from

https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/archive/master.zip

or cloned via git:
    
    git clone https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe.git


## Requirements
For all Linux distros, your version of gcc/g++ needs to be 4.7 or higher
because gcc 4.6 doesn't support the C++11 standard. It does support the
draft C++0x standard, but our makefiles have -std=c++11, which needs 4.7+

Even 4.7 doesn't seem to support the C++11 standard fully, so if you get
compilation errors, try using a more recent version of gcc, if possible.
It's best to try to build pwsafe on a recent version of Linux than
retrofit a new gcc on an old distro.

Here are the packages/tools required for building the Linux version.

### Debian/Ubuntu
- cmake (See note 1 below)
- fakeroot
- g++
- gettext
- git
- libcurl4-openssl-dev
- libqrencode-dev
- libssl-dev
- libgtest-dev
- libmagic-dev
- libuuid1
- libwxgtk3.0-dbg (See note 2 below)
- libwxgtk3.0-dev (See note 2 below)
- libxerces-c-dev
- libxt-dev
- libxtst-dev
- libykpers-1-dev (see note 3 below)
- libyubikey-dev
- make
- pkg-config
- uuid-dev
- zip

The script Misc/setup-deb-dev-env.sh can be run (sudo or as root) to
install these and setup the gtest library.

### Fedora
- cmake (See note 1 below)
- gcc-c++
- git
- gtest-devel
- file-devel
- libXt-devel
- libXtst-devel
- libcurl-devel
- libuuid-devel
- libyubikey-devel
- make
- openssl-devel
- wxGTK3-devel
- xerces-c-devel
- ykpers-devel (see note 3 below)
- qrencode-devel

The script Misc/setup-rpm-dev-env.sh can be run (sudo or as root) to
install these and setup the gtest library.


## Build
To compile without Yubikey support, set the NO_YUBI flag
for make, e.g.,

    $ NO_YUBI=1 make

(In this case, you don't need the libyubikey or libykpers-1
development packages)

--------------------
Note #1 - cmake
As of Dec. 2015 PasswordSafe can be built on Linux platforms using
cmake, e.g.

    mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

Currently, this is in addition to the 'standard' toplevel make. In the
long term, it will probably replace it.
The cmake build can be configured in the standard manner, e.g, via
cmake-gui.

If you have a custom build of the Wx library you would like to use 
you can point to its 'wx-config' command by use of cmake's command 
line option 'wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE'. You can also disable the 
gtest unit testing (option NO_GTEST), YubiKey support (option NO_YUBI) 
and QR support (option NO_QR) if they are not required.

With the mentioned cmake options, resp. preprocessor symbols the command 
line could look as follows to created a debug build.

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D NO_QR=ON -D -D NO_GTEST=ON -D wxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=~/wxWidgets-3.1.3/wxbuild/wx-config ..

To speed up the build process on a multi core system, make can be 
instructed with the option '-j' to distribute the compilation process 
over several cores or jobs.

    make -j 8

--------------------
Note #2 - wxWidgets

Some distributions lag behind the required version of wxWidgets,
providing a version older than that required by PasswordSafe. If this
is the case, you can either:

(a) Get the wxWidgets package from the relevant link in
    http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/ under "Binaries", or
    
(b) Download the sources from here
    http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
    
and build the libraries yourself. If you do so:
1. Configure the build using the following:

    ```
    $ ./configure --disable-shared --enable-stl --enable-utf8only \
    --enable-intl --enable-xlocale --enable-debug_gdb
    ```

2. Set the WX_CONFIG environment variable to point to the correct
   location, e.g. add the following to you .bashrc file:

    ```
    export WX_CONFIG=$HOME/src/wxWidgets-3.0.2/wx-config
    ```

Note that we use a static build of wxWidgets in order to simplify the
distribution, not requiring users to get the wx3 package, and avoiding
potential conflicts with 2.8.

Alternatively, the Wx library can be build using cmake.
By default shared libraries with unicode support are build. For a static 
build set option 'wxBUILD_SHARED' to 'OFF'.

Unpack the downloaded wxWidgets package and change into its directory. 
Create a new directory for the build artefacts and change to that one. 
Execute cmake with appropriate preprocessor symbols and run make (consider
using option '-j').

    cd <wxWidgets directory, e.g. wxWidgets-3.1.3>
    mkdir <build directory, e.g. wxbuild>
    cd <build directory, e.g. wxbuild>
    cmake -D wxUSE_STL=ON -D wxBUILD_SHARED=OFF ..

The internationalization system (option wxUSE_INTL) and x-locale support 
(option wxUSE_XLOCALE) is also enabled by default. For a list of options 
to tune the build see also the documentation (
[3.0](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/page_wxusedef.html), 
[3.1](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1/page_wxusedef.html)
) about wxUSE preprocessor symbols.


--------------------
Note #3 - libykpers-1/ykpers-devel:
If your distro doesn't have the development version of this you will
need to build and install it from the source:
https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization.git

In case you want to specify a non-standard location from which
yubikey-personalization headers/libs are to be used, invoke "make"
like this:

    $ YBPERS_LIBPATH=<dir with libykpers-1.a or .so> YBPERS_INC=<yubikey-pers dir/ykcore/> make unicode{release,debug}

If your build linked with libykpers-1.so in a non-standard location,
you might need to invoke pwsafe as

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<libykpers-1.a or libykpers-1.so dir> pwsafe 

--------------------

Running 'make' at the top of the source tree will result in the debug
version of pwsafe being built under src/ui/wxWidgets/GCCUnicodeDebug,
and the release version under src/ui/wxWidgets/GCCUnicodeRelease.

Note that under Fedora and RHEL5, wxGTK-devel doesn't support
"wx-config --debug=yes --unicode=yes" so just "make" fails. The
workaround is to use "make release", which will only build the release
version.

Fedora 22 didn't rebuild wxGTK with gcc 5 yet it seems, to the
ABI-version was at version 2, which was the default up until gcc
4.9. A way to solve this would be adding '-fabi-version=2' to the
CXXFLAGS.

## Create a Debian Package
Extract the source tree into some directory and change into this
directory, i.e. where CMakeLists.txt is present.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cpack -G DEB ..
```


## Install the Debian Package

    sudo dpkg -i passwordsafe-\<debian|ubuntu\>-\<version\>.\<arch\>.deb


## Create an RPM Package - Fedora
Based on the procedure for building a Debian package, an RPM based
package can be created as well:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cpack -G RPM ..
```


## Create an RPM Package using mock (Fedora or CentOS)
(Following from ykne)
To build pwsafe rpm from git on Fedora or CentOS Linux using mock:
- Install and configure mock
  https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki
- Note that CentOS needs https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL
  repository installed.
- Review and execute Misc/mock-build.sh (with no argument will compile
  for current system).
- If invoked with -r mock_arch, where mock_arch is a file name in
  /etc/mock without .cfg, then rpm will be compiled for the specified
  architecture. 

(Tested on Fedora-29 and CentOS-7)


## Install the RPM Package
To install the RPM package use the following command as root.

    dnf install passwordsafe-fedora-\<version\>.\<arch\>.rpm
