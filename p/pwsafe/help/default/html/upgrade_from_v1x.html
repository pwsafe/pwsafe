<h2>Upgrading From Previous Versions of Password Safe</h2>

<p>In order to support new features and enhance security, the database
format which is used to store entries and preferences has been changed
between major versions. However, much effort has been put into ensuring automatic
and transparent upgrading:</p>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.x of <b>Password Safe</b> can only read databases generated by versions 1.x.</li>
<li>Version 2.x of <b>Password Safe</b> can read databases created by itself, and by version 1.x of 
<b>Password Safe</b></li>
<li>Version 3.x of <b>Password Safe</b> can read databases created by all previous versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, to read a database generated by a previous version of <b>Password Safe</b>,
just open it as you would any database. The entries will be displayed
normally, with possible "unknown" values in fields that were
unsupported in previous versions (e.g., the creation date of an entry).</p>

<p>When you save such a database, you will be alerted to the fact that the new database
will be unreadable by previous version of <b>Password Safe</b>.</p>

<h3>Generating previous versions of the database</h3>

<p>You can create versions of the database that are readable by older versions of
<b>Password Safe</b> by explicitly exporting to the desired format
(<b>File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Export To</b> and select <b>V1 format... </b>or <b>V2 format...</b><b>)</b>.
Note that the exported databases will not contain information that was
added in newer versions. For example, a version 2 database will not
have information regarding the modification times of entries.</p>
