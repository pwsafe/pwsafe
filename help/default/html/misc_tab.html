<h2>Misc Tab</h2>

<img src="images/options/misc_tab.jpg" alt="Misc tab"><br>

<p>Various miscellaneous program defaults are displayed in the <b>Misc Tab</b>.</p>

<h3>Confirm deletion of items</h3>

<p>When checked, a user prompt requesting confirmation will be displayed every
time you try to delete a password entry.<p>

<h3>Record last access times</h3>

<p>When checked, <b>Password Safe</b> records the time
each entry was accessed (e.g., when the password was copied, or when the entry's details were
viewed, etc.). The time is stored with the entry, and may be viewed in the entry's dialog box.</p>

<b>Notes:</b><br>

<small>
<ul>
<li>When this is enabled, the database will be modified even
when no entry was edited. This means you may be prompted to save the
database upon exit, even though you didn't explicitly change anything.</li>

<li>When the database is opened in read-only mode, access times are
<b>not</b> updated.</li>
</ul>
</small>

<h3>Escape key closes application</h3>

<p>When checked, <b>Esc</b> can be used to close <b>Password Safe</b>
when the program is maximized. Note that if the System Tray is enabled
(via the Put Icon in System Tray option), then <b>Esc</b> just closes
the main window, which can be re-opened by double-clicking on the icon
in the System Tray.</p>

<h3>Double click action</h3>

<p>This allows you to define what action <b>Password Safe</b> will take when
you double-click on an entry. The default is to copy the entry's
password to the clipboard. &nbsp;The available actions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>AutoType</li>
<li>Browse to URL</li>
<li>Browse to URL + AutoType</li>
<li>Copy notes to clipboard</li>
<li>Copy password to clipboard</li>
<li>Copy password to clipboard, minimize</li>
<li>Copy username to clipboard</li>
<li>Run Command</li>
<li>Send email</li>
<li>View/Edit selected entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that last item, copy password and then minimize, won't work as
expected if the "Clear clipboard on minimize" option is selected in the
<a href="security_tab.html">Security Options tab</a>.</p>

<h3>AutoType</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Minimize after AutoType</b> By default, <b>Password Safe</b>
minimizes when autotyping. If this checkbox is cleared, <b>Password Safe</b>
will move "behind" all displayed windows instead.</li>
<li><b>Default AutoType String</b> Here you can specify the AutoType
string to use by default for all entries. Note that you can override
this on a per-entry basis. This option is useful, for example, if you
wish to change the delays for all entries. See <a href="autotype.html">here</a>
for more details on AutoType.</li>
<li><b>Default AutoType Delay</b> This is the amount of time, in
  milli-seconds, that PasswordSafe waits between characters when
  performing the autotype. The default, 10mS, should be fine for most
  systems. You may want to decrease it (make it faster) if you've a
  fast PC, or increase it (slow it down) for an older machine. In any
  case, you can also change this per-entry, as
  described <a href="autotype.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Default Username</h3>

<p>This allows you to set a default user name that will be used
automatically every time a new password entry is generated. when checked,
the name entered will be inserted into new entries' user name field as the
default. Of course, you can edit it if needed.<br></p>

<h3><a name="AltBrowser"></a>Alternate Browser</h3>

<p>The browser you specify in this field &nbsp;will be used when using the
"Browse To" function for a selected entry, when the entry's URL has
"[alt]" before the URL, e.g., "[alt]http://www.foo.net". This is
useful, for example, if your default browser is Firefox, and you wish
to access a website that works best with Internet Explorer, in which case you
should specify the Internet Explorer as your alternate browser (typically
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplorer.exe).</p>


<p>You can specify command line options to the browser via the Browser
command line parameters field. Do <b>not</b> enclose this value in single or
double quotes unless your chosen browser requires them.</p>

<h3><a name="ExtEditor"></a>External Editor</h3>

<p>The external editor you specify in this field will be used when
right clicking on an entry's Notes field and selecting to edit the field
using an external editor. For more information, see
<a href="entering_pwd.html#notes_external_editor">"User Names, Passwords, and Groups: Notes"</a>.
</p>

<p>You can specify command line options to the external editor via the external
editor command line parameters field. Do <b>not</b> enclose this value in single or
double quotes unless your chosen external editor requires them.</p>
