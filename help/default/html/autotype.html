<h2>Auto Type</h2>


<p><b>Auto Type </b>provides a means for users to
easily and quickly
enter user name and password information. With a single click, the user
name and password are entered and the data is submitted to the host for
approval. By default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes
is as follows: the user name, followed by a tab key, followed by the
password, another tab, and then the enter key (<i>username</i>
<b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB </b><b>ENTER</b>). This works fine for most web sites that require username/password authentication.</p>


<p>For web sites or applications that require different data, it is possible to
tailor the autotype behaviour as described in the <a href="#autotype_details">Customizing Auto Type</a>
section below.</p>


<div class="instr">
<h3>Using Auto Type</h3>


<ol>


  <li>Place cursor in the form's user name field</li>


  <li>Maximize or open Password Safe</li>


  <li>Select a password entry</li>


  <li><b>Ctrl -T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform
Auto Type</b> to or click on the Toolbar button to initiate.</li>


</ol>


<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing
Auto Type</h3>


<p>For web sites or applications that do not have the username field followed by
the
password field followed by the login button, you can modify the
behaviour by filling in the <a href="#N1">"Autotype" field</a>&nbsp;with text that
specifies the desired behavior as follows:</p>


<ul>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\u</span>
is replaced by the username associated with the entry.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\p</span>
is replaced by the password associated with the entry.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\t</span>
is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\n</span>
is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\\</span>
is replaced by the backslash (\) key.&nbsp;</li>


  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\d<span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span></span>
sets the delay between characters to <span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span> milliseconds,
instead of 10 (the default).<br>
<hr> <small><b>Note</b> that you can string together a number of the \d commands. For example, \d999\d999\d999\d010 gives you 3 seconds delay. The \d command both sets the character delay and also does a delay on its own.</small><hr>

  </li>


  <li>All other text is typed as-is.<br>


  </li>


</ul>


<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</span>
The following can be used where the bank account number (12345) must be
entered before the user and password:<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">12345\t\u\t\p\t\n</span></p>


<p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>


</div>


<hr> <small><b><a name="N1"></a>Note:</b>&nbsp;By default, the
Autotype field is not displayed in the Add or Edit dialog boxes.
To access the Autotype field, you may have to click on the
"More&gt;&gt;" button in the dialog box.</small>
