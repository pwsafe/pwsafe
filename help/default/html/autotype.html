<h2>AutoType</h2>

<p><b>AutoType</b> provides a means for you to easily and quickly
enter user name and password information. With a single click, the user
name and password are entered and the data is submitted to the host for
approval. By default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes
is as follows: <a name="defautotext">the user name, followed by a tab
key, followed by the password, another tab, and then the enter key</a>
(<i>username</i> <b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB ENTER</b>). This works
fine for most web sites that require username/password authentication.</p>

<p>For web sites or applications that require different data, you can tailor the AutoType behaviour as described in the
<a href="#autotype_details">Customizing AutoType</a> section below.
Note that you can also customize the <i><a href="#defautotext">default</a></i>
AutoType text via the <i><a href="misc_tab.html">Misc.</a></i> tab in
the Options dialog box. This can be useful if, for example, the default 
AutoType timing is too fast for your machine.</p>

<p>In addition, you can invoke AutoType after running an arbitrary command specified in the entry's <a href="run_command.html">Run Cmd</a> field.
This is a very convenient combination.</p>

<h3>Using AutoType</h3>

<ol>
<li>Place cursor in the form's username field</li>
<li>Maximize or open <b>Password Safe</b></li>
<li>Select a password entry</li>
<li><b>Ctrl+T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform AutoType</b>
or click on the Toolbar button to initiate.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing AutoType</h3>

<p>For web sites or applications that do not have the username
field followed by the password field followed by the login button,
you can modify the behaviour by filling in the <a href="#N1">"AutoType" field</a>
with text that specifies the desired behavior as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>\u</b> is replaced by the username associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\p</b> is replaced by the password associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\g</b> is replaced by the group associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\i</b> is replaced by the title associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\l</b> is replaced by the URL associated with the entry (that's the letter ell, not the digit '1').</li>
<li><b>\m</b> is replaced by the e-mail associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\o</b> is replaced by the contents of the (possibly multilined) Notes field.</li>
<ul>
<li>Any end of line characters '\n', '\r' or '\r\n' are converted to '\r'
(carriage return).</li>
<li>No substitution is made to escape sequences within the Notes field 
(e.g. '\u', '\p' etc.) except for the '\t' sequence, which is replaced by
the Tab character and '\s' sequence, which is replaced by "Shift+Tab".</li>
</ul>
<li><b>\o<i>NNN</i></b> is replaced by the contents of the n<sup>th</sup>
line of the Notes field</li>
<ul>
<li><i>NNN</i> can be one to three digits (e.g., \o5 for the 5<sup>th</sup>
line, \o45 for the 45<sup>th</sup>, etc.</li>
<li>End of line characters are <i>not </i> included.</li>
<li>if <i>NNN </i>is larger than the number of lines in the notes field,
then this has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<small><b>Note</b> that this is a convenient way to support
autotyping for applications that require a second password or other
arbitrary text as part of the authentication process.</small>

<hr>
<li><b>\b</b> is replaced by the backspace key.</li>
<li><b>\t</b> is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.</li>
<li><b>\s</b> is replaced by the "Shift+Tab", in effect back-tabbing to the previous field.</li>
<li><b>\n</b> is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.</li>
<li><b>\\</b> is replaced by the backslash (\) key.</li>
<li><b>\d<i>NNN</i></b> sets the delay between characters to <i>NNN</i>
milliseconds, instead of 10 (the default). This changes the delay for the current and
all subsequent characters. For example, "fast\d500slow" will result in
'fast' being typed with the default delay, and the letters 's', 'l',
'o', and 'w' typed with a half-second pause before each. if you want to
put in a one-time delay that does not affect the speed of the following
characters, use '\w' or '\W', as described below.</li>
<li><b>\w<i>NNN</i> or <i>\WNNN</i></b> introduces a delay of <i>NNN</i> milliseconds
for \w, or seconds if \W is used. For example, "how\w500now" will cause
'how' to be typed (at the default rate or that specified by the last
\d), followed by a half-second pause, followed by 'now' typed at the
same rate as 'how'). Likewise, "how\W2now" will introduce a two second
pause between the two words. This is useful for fine-tuning the timing with certain web pages.</li>
<li>Note that <em>NNN</em> in the above is limited to three digits, so that, for example, \w5000 will create a half-second delay
and then emit the letter '0', which is probably not what you intended (\W5 would do the trick, though).</li>
<li><b>\z</b> invokes the old AutoType mechanism.  This mechanism may handle
non-Latin characters incorrectly, but can make AutoType work on certain problematical web sites.
<i><u>If you find that AutoType does not work properly on a particular web site, try this code
at the beginning of the AutoType command field.</u></i></li>
<li><b>\c</b> (Linux only) generates the key events that cause a platform-specific Select-All
command. It is useful when autotype conflicts with browser's autofill, where the two texts
combine instead of autotype'd text replacing the auto-filled text.  Generating a <b>\c</b> at
the start of autotyping inside a field (at the very beginning of autotype string, or just after
a <b>\t</b>) ensures that the autofill'ed text gets replaced by the autotype'd text. For some
sites, you might also need to autotype <i>slowly</i>, for which put <b>\d100</b> at the begining
of your autotype string. So your autotype string could look like
<pre>
\d100\c\u\t\c\p\n
</pre>
</li>
<li><b>\j</b> (Linux only) starts generating independent key events for modifier keys like ALT,
SHIFT, etc.</li>
<li><b>\k</b> (Linux only) stops generating independent keystrokes for modifier keys and only
simulates the modifications (like making things uppercase) with flags to main key events.</li>
<li><b>\j</b> and <b>\k</b> could be useful when you find that autotype is not maintaining case-sensitivity of autotyped text, or is producing the lower keys (3 instead of #).</li>
<li>All other text is typed as-is.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default autotype sequence in Password Safe is \u\t\p\n. This default can be changed
via the Manage/Options menu (Misc. tab).</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b>
The following can be used where the bank account number (12345) must be
entered before the user and password:<a name="N1"></a>
<pre>
    <i>12345\t\u\t\p\t\n</i>
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b>
The following sequence has been suggested by a user as it should clear the username field first
before username and password autotype begins. Non-empty username fields occur all the time.
Some sites remember the username even when the user does not want it to or user forgets to clear
the don't remember username and, because of browser cookies, it is remembered anyway, or if login
fails for whatever reason on the first attempt the username would still remain. This autotype
sequence should ensure that the user doesn't have to clear a non-empty username field first.
<pre>
    <i>\t\s\b\u\t\p\n</i>
</pre>
</p>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> If you are having problems with AutoType, you might want to disable
3rd-party popup-blockers. Users have reported problems with the
interaction of popup-blockers with the AutoType functionality.</small>
