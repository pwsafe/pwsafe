<h2>AutoType</h2> 

<p><b>AutoType</b> provides a means for you to easily and quickly enter 
user name and password information. With a single click, the user name 
and password are entered and the data is submitted to the host for 
approval. By default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes 
is as follows: <a name="defautotext">the user name, followed by a tab 
key, followed by the password, another tab, and then the enter key</a> 
(<i>username</i> <b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB ENTER</b>). This 
works fine for most web sites that require username/password 
authentication.</p> 

<p>For web sites or applications that require different data, you can 
tailor the AutoType behaviour as described in the <a 
href="#autotype_details">Customizing AutoType</a> section below. Note 
that you can also customize the <i><a 
href="#defautotext">default</a></i> AutoType text via the <i><a 
href="misc_tab.html">Misc.</a></i> tab in the Options dialog box. This 
can be useful if, for example, the default AutoType timing is too fast 
for your machine.</p> 

<p>In addition, you can invoke AutoType after running an arbitrary 
command specified in the entry's <a href="run_command.html">Run Cmd</a> 
field. This is a very convenient combination.</p> 

<h3>Using AutoType</h3> 

<ol>
<li>Place cursor in the form's username field</li>
<li>Maximize or 
open <b>Password Safe</b></li>
<li>Select a password entry</li> 
<li><b>Ctrl+T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform AutoType</b> or 
click on the Toolbar button to initiate.</li> </ol> 

<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing AutoType</h3> 

<p>For web sites or applications that do not have the username field 
followed by the password field followed by the login button, you can 
modify the behaviour by filling in the <a href="#N1">"AutoType" 
field</a> with text that specifies the desired behavior as follows:</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>\u</b> is replaced by the username associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\p</b> is replaced by the password associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\q</b> is replaced by the last password associated with the entry from
the entry's password history as long as this entry's password history is still
active. If not active or if there are no current old passwords, the field is
removed but not replaced with anything.</li>
<li><b>\g</b> is replaced by the group associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\i</b> is replaced by the title associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\l</b> is replaced by the URL associated with the entry (that's the letter
ell, not the digit '1').</li>
<li><b>\m</b> is replaced by the e-mail associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\o</b> is replaced by the contents of the (possibly multilined) Notes field.</li> 
<ul>
<li>Any end of line characters '\n', '\r' or '\r\n' are converted to '\r' (carriage return).</li>
<li>No substitution is made to escape sequences within the Notes field
(e.g. '\u', '\p' etc.) except for the '\t' sequence, which is replaced by the Tab
character and '\s' sequence, which is replaced by "Shift+Tab".</li>
</ul>
<li><b>\o<i>NNN</i></b> is replaced by the contents of the n<sup>th</sup> line
of the Notes field</li>
<ul>
<li><i>NNN</i> can be one to three digits (e.g., \o5 for 
the 5<sup>th</sup> line, \o45 for the 45<sup>th</sup>, etc.</li>
<li>if <i>NNN</i> is larger than the number of lines in the notes field, then
this has no effect and no lines from the Notes field are copied.</li>
<li>if <i>NNN</i> is zero then all lines are copied i.e. \o0 is equivalent to \o.</li>
<li>End of line characters are <i>not</i> included.</li>
</ul>

<hr> 
<small><b>Note</b> that this is a convenient way to support autotyping 
for applications that require a second password or other arbitrary text 
as part of the authentication process.</small> 
<hr>

<li><b>\b</b> is replaced by the backspace key.</li>
<li><b>\t</b> is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.</li> 
<li><b>\s</b> is replaced by the "Shift+Tab", in effect back-tabbing to 
the previous field.</li>
<li><b>\n</b> is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.</li>
<li><b>\\</b> is replaced by the backslash (\) key.</li>
<li><b>\d<i>NNN</i></b> sets the delay between characters to <i>NNN</i> milliseconds,
instead of 10 (the default). This changes the delay for the current and all
subsequent characters. For example, "fast\d500slow" will result in 'fast' being 
typed with the default delay, and the letters 's', 'l', 'o', and 'w' typed with a 
half-second pause before each. if you want to put in a one-time delay 
that does not affect the speed of the following characters, use '\w' or 
'\W', as described below.<br><br>
Note that <em>NNN</em> is limited to a maximum of three digits.</li>
<li><b>\w<i>NNN</i> or <i>\WNNN</i></b> introduces a delay of <i>NNN</i> milliseconds
for \w, or seconds if \W is used. For example, "how\w500now" will cause 'how' to
be typed (at the default rate or that specified by the last \d), followed by a 
half-second pause, followed by 'now' typed at the same rate as 'how'). 
Likewise, "how\W2now" will introduce a two second pause between the two 
words. This is useful for fine-tuning the timing with certain web pages.<br><br>
Note that <em>NNN</em> in the above is limited to a maximum of three 
digits, so that, for example, \w5000 will create a half-second delay and 
then emit the letter '0', which is probably not what you intended (\W5 
would do the trick, though).</li>
<a name="z"></a><li><b>\z</b> (Windows only) invokes the old AutoType mechanism. 
This mechanism may handle non-Latin characters incorrectly, but can make AutoType 
work on certain problematical web sites. <i><u>If you find that AutoType does not 
work properly on a particular web site, try this code at the beginning of the 
AutoType command field. However, if this field is specified 
<b>anywhere</b> in the AutoType string, it applies to the whole string.</u></i></li> 
<li><b>\&#35;</b> (Windows only) is exactly the same as \z above except that
it toggles using the old AutoType mechanism on/off for the part of the AutoType
string between these codes. The use of \# instead of \z <i>may</i> prevent issues 
with sending non-Latin characters in other parts of the AutoType string as can 
happen when using the \z field.  <i><u>However, \&#35; will be ignored if the \z 
field has been specified <b>anywhere</b> in the AutoType string.</u></i>. For 
example, the following will switch to the old mechanism to just send a tab and a 
space:
<pre>
\&#35;\t \&#35;
</pre></li>
<li><b>\c</b> (Linux only) generates the key events that cause a platform-specific
Select-All command. It is useful when autotype conflicts with browser's autofill,
where the two texts combine instead of autotype'd text replacing the auto-filled 
text. 
Generating a <b>\c</b> at the start of autotyping inside a field (at the 
very beginning of autotype string, or just after a <b>\t</b>) ensures 
that the autofill'ed text gets replaced by the autotype'd text. For some 
sites, you might also need to autotype <i>slowly</i>, for which put 
<b>\d100</b> at the beginning of your autotype string. So your autotype 
string could look like
<pre>
\d100\c\u\t\c\p\n
</pre>
</li> 
<li><b>\j</b> (Linux only) starts generating independent key events for 
modifier keys like ALT, SHIFT, etc.</li>
<li><b>\k</b> (Linux only) stops generating independent keystrokes for modifier
keys and only simulates the modifications (like making things uppercase) with
flags to main key events.</li>
<li><b>\j</b> and <b>\k</b> could be useful when you find that autotype is not
maintaining case-sensitivity of autotyped text, or is producing the lower keys
(3 instead of #).</li>
<li><u>All other text is typed as-is.</u></li>
</ul> 

<p>For <u>Windows only</u>, the following special control codes are also 
implemented:</p> <table style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:5px"> 
<tr><td><b>\{Enter}</b></td><td>Enter key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Up}</b></td><td>Up-arrow key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Down}</b></td><td>Down-arrow key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Left}</b></td><td>Left-arrow key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Right}</b></td><td>Right-arrow key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Home}</b></td><td>Home key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{End}</b></td><td>End key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{PgUp}</b></td><td>Page-up key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{PgDn}</b></td><td>Page-down key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Tab}</b></td><td>Tab key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>\{Space}</b></td><td>Space bar</td></tr> </table> 

<p>The special control code between the curley brackets is not case 
sensitive and is unaffected by the presence of the "\z" AutoType field.</p> 

<p>In addition, the following modifiers are available to combine with 
the above special control codes. These <u>must</u> precede the code and 
can be combined in any order. They are:</p> <table 
style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:10px"> 
<tr><td><b>!</b></td><td>Alt key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>^</b></td><td>Control key</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>+</b></td><td>Shift key</td></tr> </table> 

<p>For example:<br> "\{+Tab}" is equivalent to "Shift+Tab"<br> "\{+^Tab}" is
equivalent to "Ctrl+Shift+Tab"<br> "\{^Home}" is equivalent to "Control+Home".</p> 

<h4>Aliases and Shortcuts</h4>

<h5>Shortcuts</h5>

<p>The AutoType string and all entry variables, e.g. \p for password, come for
the shortcut's base entry. <i>No entry variables come from the shortcut entry
itself.</i></p>

<h5>Aliases</h>

<p>The AutoType string and all entry variables <u>except</u> the current password 
(\p) and previous password (\q) come from the alias entry.  The two password
exceptions come from the alias's base entry.</p>

<h3>Default AutoType</h3>

<p>The default autotype sequence in Password Safe is \u\t\p\n. This 
default can be changed via the Manage/Options menu (Misc. tab).</p> 

<h3>Examples</h3> 

<p><b>Example 1:</b> The following can be used where the bank account 
number (12345) must be entered before the user and password:
<a name="N1"></a>
<pre>
<i>12345\t\u\t\p\t\n</i>
</pre> 
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b> The following sequence, sent in by a user, clears the username field before username and password
autotype begins. Non-empty username fields occur all the time. Some 
sites remember the username even when the user does not want it to or 
user forgets to clear the don't remember username and, because of 
browser cookies, it is remembered anyway, or if login fails for whatever 
reason on the first attempt the username would still remain. This 
autotype sequence should ensure that the user doesn't have to clear a 
non-empty username field first.
<pre>
<i>\t\s\u\t\p\n</i>
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b> The following sequence, sent in by a user,
 toggles a checkbox (e.g., disables keeping you logged in):
<pre> 
<i>\&#35;\t \&#35;</i>
</pre> Note: You may need more tabs ('\t') in order to get to the desired
checkbox on any particular webpage. Also, please see <a href="#z">above</a> on possible issues
when using the '\z' field. </p> 

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> If you are having problems with AutoType, you 
might want to disable 3rd-party popup-blockers. Users have reported 
problems with the interaction of popup-blockers with the AutoType 
functionality.</small>
