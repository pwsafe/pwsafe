<h2>View Menu</h2>

<img alt="View Menu" src="images/view_menu.jpg">

<p>The <b>View Menu</b> controls the available display options. You can
switch between how your entries are
shown: either as a single list (<b>Flattened List</b>) or organized by category
(<b>Nested Tree</b>).
You can choose whether or not to display a toolbar, and if so, whether to
use the 'Classic' or 'New' toolbar icons. The toolbar itself is also
customizable. You can also expand or collapse all the groups displayed
in the Nested Tree view, display subsets of the entries, filter the entries displayed to match any
criteria, select the font in which the entries are displayed and
display reports of merge, compare, import and other advanced operations.</p>

<h3>Switching Between Nested Tree and Flattened List Views</h3>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <b>View</b> menu</li>
<li>Select <b>Nested Tree</b> or <b>Flattened List</b></li>
</ol>

<h3>Controlling the Toolbars</h3>

<p>To display or hide the toolbar, check or uncheck the <b>Toolbar Visible </b>menu item.<br>

To use "new" or "classic" toolbar icons, select the "<b>New toolbar</b>" or
"<b>Classic toolbar</b>" menu item, respectively.<br>

<h3>Dragbar</h3>

<p>The "<b>Dragbar</b>" is a special toolbar that allows you to paste 
parts of the currently selected entry by "dragging" the icon specifying 
the part you want to paste to where you want it to be pasted 
to. For example, to paste the "Notes" text of a given entry to another 
application using the Dragbar, select the entry, and then drag the "N" 
icon from the Dragbar to the application. When you release the left 
mouse button, the contents of the Notes field will be pasted to the 
application. The Dragbar will disable ("grey out") icons for fields that 
are empty in the selected entry. <br>
The 'AutoType' Dragbar button behaves in a slightly different
manner: Dragging it to an input area on another Window
(e.g. Browser) will cause <b>Password Safe</b> to begin AutoType from there.</p>

<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>There appears to be an issue using the new AutoType Dragbar image with
Internet Explorer (tested with V7, V8 &amp; V9) in that any characters typed
before the first tab character are lost. This does <u>NOT</u> occur with Firefox
and Chrome browsers. Although we have a solution for this (we send a Tab followed
by a Shift+Tab to return to the selected window <u>only</u> when using this Dragbar
AutoType image), the side-effect is
that you can only use the Dragbar AutoType image to replace any existing string in
that window by the expanded AutoType string. If dropped in a window of another
application the result will depend on how that application processes the Tab and Shift+Tab
characters.
<li>If the <i>control</i> key is pressed while clicking on a Dragbar icon, the relevant text is copied to the clipboard <em>in addition</em>
to being pasted when the mouse button is released. This can be useful in cases where the drop "missed" by a pixel or two, allowing you to
perform a paste operation, rather than trying to drag again.</li>
</ul></p>

To display or hide the Dragbar, check or uncheck the <b>Dragbar Visible</b> menu item.

<h3>Expand All</h3>

<p>Expands all groups, making all entries visible <i>(Nested Tree view only)</i>.</p>

<h3>Collapse All</h3>

<p>Collapses all groups <i>(Nested Tree view only)</i>.</p>

<h3>Subviews</h3>

<img alt="Subviews" src="images/subviews_menu.jpg">

<p>"Subviews" are predefined filters that when selected, show only the entries that match their criteria.</p>

<p>As all filters, they can be cleared by double-clicking the red and white striped
"filter active" indicator at the bottom right of the Status Bar, as can be seen in the
following images where the filter is active.</p>

<h4>1. Unsaved changes</h4>

<p>If item <b>Save database immediately after Edit or Add</b> in menu
<a href="backups_tab.html">Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Backups</a>
is unchecked, changed item will not be saved immediately, but they will be shown in a different
colour. See the next picture:</p>

<p>Overview of all entries:<br>
<img alt="Data with changes" src="images/tree_view_change.jpg"></p>

<p>By checking this item, only changed and unsaved items will be shown.  If this filter
is active and you save your database changes, it will be cancelled and the
full database will be displayed.</p>

<p>Overview of all changed entries:<br>
<img alt="Data, only changes" src="images/tree_view_change_only.jpg"></p>

<p><small><b>Note:</b> As long as there are some unsaved items, there will be
a "*" in the status area at the bottom of the application's window.</small></p>

<h4>2. Expiry dates</h4>

<p>If you select this menu item, only entries with a defined expiry date will
be shown in the list. It does not matter that the expiry date is in
the past or future.</p>

<p>If there aren't any entries with expiry date, this menu item will
be grayed out.</p>

<img alt="Expired Password Filter" src="images/expired_password_filter.jpg">

<h4>3. Last Find results</h4>

<p>If you select this menu item, only entries that were found during the last
Find operation will be shown. If a Find hadn't been performed or it had been cleared,
then this menu item will be grayed out. If the Find Toolbar was visible when this
filter was activated, it will be closed, since  <u>no new Finds can be performed whilst
this filter is active</u>. Find Next (F3) and Find Previous (Shift-F3) will still be
available.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If this filter is active, as it is based on displaying entries in the database
found during the last Find operation and only these, i.e. the <u>Find operation
is not redone</u> should the database be changed.  For example:<br>
<ul>
<li>If an entry is edited so that it no longer satisfies the previous Find,
it will still be displayed.</li>
<li>If an entry is duplicated, the new copy will not be included in the display.</li>
<li>If an entry is deleted, it will be removed from the display.</li>
<li>If the above deleted entry is reinstated, i.e. via Undo (Ctrl-Z), the entry will
again be displayed.</li>
<li>If new entries are added either directly or, say, via Merge, these will also not be
displayed as they were not in the database when the last Find operation was performed.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><a name="user_defined_filters"></a>User defined Filters</h3>

<p>A "filter" is a criteria (or set of criteria) that an entry either matches
or doesn't match. <b>Password Safe</b> allows you to define filters and display
only those entries that match a given filter. For more information on defining
and using filters, see <a href="filters.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Change Font</h3>

<img alt="Change Fonts" src="images/change_font_menu.jpg">

<p>Select a different font for displaying entries in the List or Tree
views, and for displaying passwords in the Add and Edit Entry dialog
boxes.  You can also specify the font to use in the Virtual Keyboard.
Note that this font must be able to display Unicode characters. Supported
fonts include: "Arial Unicode MS" (which comes with Microsoft's Office suite),
"Arial Unicode" and "Lucida Sans Unicode", although you may select another using
 the appropriate menu item.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<img alt="View Reports" src="images/view_reports_menu.jpg">

<p>If you save the results of Compare, Export, Find, Import, Merge, Synchronize
and Validate operations to disk, they are stored in the same directory as the
database.  If you repeat one of these operations and again save the report
to disk, it will overwrite any previous report for this operation without
requesting permission.  You may view these reports at a later date when you
open a database in this same directory.</p>

<h3>Refresh F5</h3>
<p>Refreshes the display either by pressing the F5 key or clicking on this menu item.</p>
