<h2>Importing Entries</h2>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> allows you to import
password information from other formats. These files may be generated by other applications,
exported from a spreadsheet, or even written by hand using Notepad or a similar
text editor.</p>

<p>The formats that <b>Password Safe</b> supports are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#text">Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#XML">XML</a></li>
<li><a href="#KeePassV1_TXTCSV">KeePass V1 TXT and CSV Files</a></li>
<li><a href="#KeePassV2_CSV">KeePass V2 via KeePass V1 CSV Files</a></li>
<li><a href="#KeePassXML">KeePass V1 and V2 XML Files</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> generates a report at the end of the import operation, 
  summarizing what was done and noting any problems that may have
  occurred. This report may be copied to the clipboard or saved to
  disk as a text file in the same directory as the database.
  The "View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Reports" menu item may then be used to
view the reports at a later date. The name of the report file is fixed and
depends on the function that created it. If the same function is repeated
and its report saved to disk, any existing report for this function will be
overwritten. <span style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The report may contain sensitive data and
care should be taken when selecting the "save to disk" option.</span></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You can also 'import' a subset of entries from another <b>Password Safe</b>
database, by  opening the other database with <b>Password Safe</b>
  (assuming you permit multiple instances via 
<a href="system_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;System"</a>
tab). Then you can simply drag and drop any entries or groups to your open database
from this 'import' database. </p>

<h3><a name="text"></a>Text Format</h3>

<p>Text files used to import password entries consist of one or
more password entries. Each field within an entry is separated by a
field separator and each entry may consist of one or more
lines. Details on the expected format of the imported text file
may be found in the "<a href="imp_exp_text_details.html">Plain Text Export &amp; Import Format</a>" section.</p>

<h3>Import Text Settings Dialog</h3>

<p>The field separator used in the text file being imported and a default group
name to import the new entries into can be configured before processing the file.</p>

<p><img alt="Import Text Settings" src="images/import.jpg"></p>
<ol>
<li><b>"File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Import From...."</b></li>
<li>Select <b>Plain Text...</b></li>
<li>Set import settings and parameters for the text file being imported</li>
<li>If a Notes field multi-line delimiter character has been
used, either in a previous Export or using a text editor, enter it here
so that, during the Import process, the Notes field will be split into
multiple lines by replacing this character by a newline.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
<li>Select the text file to import.</li>
<li>At the end of the import process, a small dialog box appears
showing how many entries were added, and how many (if any) were
unsuccessfully parsed.</li>
</ol>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<small><b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IMPORTANT</b>: If an entry that uses a
Password Policy Name is imported and that name is not already in the current
receiving database, then the resulting entry in the database will
revert to using the database's default Password Policy.<br>
</small>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<small><b style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IMPORTANT</b>: The
first line of the file being imported must be a tab-separated list of
the names of the fields that each entry contains, e.g.,
"Group/Title&nbsp;Username&nbsp;Password&nbsp;URL", etc. This line is generated
automatically by the "<a href="export.html">Export Text</a>" function,
but must be added manually for files created from other tools.<br>
</small>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3><a name="XML"></a>XML</h3>

<p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a popular format for transferring
data between applications. <b>Password Safe</b>
can import XML files that were generated according to the schema defined in
the file <i>pwsafe.xsd</i>, which is provided as part of the distribution.</p>

<p>When importing XML into an empty database, any database preferences in the beginning
of the XML input file will be imported into the database.  If the current receiving database
already has entries, then these preferences will be ignored.</p>

<p>However, any "Password Policy Names" in the XML input file will be imported irrespective
of whether there are entries already in the current receiving database.  Note however, if a
Password Policy with the same name already exists in the database, it will <u>not</u> be overwritten
by the values in the XML input file.</p>

<p>If an entry that uses a Password Policy Name is imported and that name is neither in the
current receiving database nor in XML input file, then the resulting entry in the database will
revert to using the database's default Password Policy.</p>

<p><u>Change of the coding of XML Date/time values</u></p>

<div class="indent">
<p>Prior to PasswordSafe V3.26, date time fields were exported in our own format:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;name&gt;
    &lt;date&gt;yyyy-mm-dd&lt;/date&gt;
    &lt;time&gt;hh:mm:ss&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/name&gt;
</pre>
<p>Where "name" was any of our record date/time fields e.g. 'ctime', 'atime', 'xtime',
'pmtime', 'rmtime' and the password history 'changed' date/time.</p>

<p>However, from V3.26 onwards, PasswordSafe will only export XML date/time fields using the
International W3C Standard date/time format. V3.26 and V3.27 can input either format but
for versions after 3.27, it will <b><u>only</u></b> accept the W3C standard.</p>

<p>The W3C standard for XML date/time fields is:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;namex&gt;yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss&lt;/namex&gt;
</pre>
<p>Where we have changed the "name" to distinguish the fields from the old format by appending an 'x'
and so 'namex' is any of our new record date/time fields e.g. 'ctimex', 'atimex', 'xtimex',
'pmtimex', 'rmtimex' and the password history 'changedx' date/time.</p>

<p>To import an older format XML file with date/time fields, you must manually edit these fields to
convert to the old PasswordSafe format to the W3C standard format.</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="KeePassV1_TXTCSV"></a>KeePass V1 TXT and CSV Files</h3>

<p><u>The recommended import of KeePass V1 database entries is via XML as described </u>
<a href="#KeePassXML"><u>below</u></a>.</p>

<h4>TXT File</h4>

<p>You may also import a TXT file exported from Keepass V1 (tested on files created
by V1.19b).</p>

<p>The following fields are converted to the <b>Password Safe</b> equivalents:</p>
Each new entry starts with a line beginning with '[' and ending with as ']'. The text 
between these will be imported as the 'Title' of this entry.<p>

<p>Each piece of information is on one line and the following tags are at the beginning
of each line:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Group: " becomes the entry's Group</li>
<li>"Group Tree: " becomes the entry's group hierarchy to the root</li>
<li>"User Name: " becomes the entry's User Name</li>
<li>"Password: " becomes the entry's Password</li>
<li>"URL: " becomes the entry's URL</li>
<li>"Notes: " becomes the entry's Notes</li>
<li>"UUID: " becomes the internal unique ID of the <b>Password Safe</b> entry</li>
<li>"Creation Time: " becomes the entry's creation time</li>
<li>"Last Access: " becomes the entry's last accessed time</li>
<li>"Last Modification: " becomes the entry's password and the entry's last modification time</li>
<li>"Expires: " becomes the entry's expiry date</li>
</ul>

<p>The following fields are currently ignored:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Icon"</li>
<li>"Attachment Description"</li>
<li>"Attachment" - do <b><u>NOT</u></b> export this field as it can make the export file extremely large.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that times in <b>Password Safe</b> must be earlier than
  January 19, 2038.  Any time later than this is currently
treated as invalid and the associated field is unset.</p>

<p>Please note, you <b><u>MUST</u></b> check the box <i>"Encode/replace newline characters by '\n'"</i>
during the export from Keepass V1 or <u>the import may fail or give unexpected results.</u></p>

<h4>CSV File</h4>

<p>You may also import a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file exported from Keepass V1 (tested on files created
by V1.19b).</p>

<p>The following fields are converted to the <b>Password Safe</b> equivalents:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Password Groups" becomes the entry's Group</li>
<li>"Group Tree" becomes the entry's group hierarchy to the root</li>
<li>"Account" becomes the entry's Title</li>
<li>"Login Name" becomes the entry's User Name</li>
<li>"Password" becomes the entry's Password</li>
<li>"Web Site" becomes the entry's URL</li>
<li>"Comments" becomes the entry's Notes</li>
<li>"UUID" becomes the internal unique ID of the <b>Password Safe</b> entry</li>
<li>"Creation Time" becomes the entry's creation time</li>
<li>"Last Access" becomes the entry's last accessed time</li>
<li>"Last Modification" becomes the entry's password and the entry's last modification time</li>
<li>"Expires" becomes the entry's expiry date</li>
</ul>

<p>The following fields are currently ignored:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Icon"</li>
<li>"Attachment Description"</li>
<li>"Attachment" - do <b><u>NOT</u></b> export this field as it can make the export file extremely large.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that times in <b>Password Safe</b> must be earlier than
  January 19, 2038.  Any time later than this is currently
  treated as invalid and that the associated field is unset.</p>

<p>Please note, you <b><u>MUST</u></b> check the box <i>"Encode/replace newline characters by '\n'"</i>
during the export from Keepass V1 or <u>the import may fail or give unexpected results.</u></p>

<h3><a name="KeePassV2_CSV"></a>KeePass V2 via KeePass V1 CSV Files</h3>

<p><u>The recommended import of KeePass V2 database entries is via XML as described </u>
<a href="#KeePassXML"><u>below</u></a>.</p>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> cannot import any file created by KeePass V2 - even the KeePass V1 CSV format
available from this program.  However, it is possible to
export a KeePass V2 database as a KeePass V1 database.  You may then export this to either a
TXT or CSV file and imported as described <a href="#KeePassV1_TXTCSV">above</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="KeePassXML"></a>KeePass V1 and V2 XML Files</h3>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> cannot directly import a XML file exported by KeePass V1 or V2 as the fields are
too different. However, we have provided XSL Transform files (KPV1_to_PWS.xslt and KPV2_to_PWS.xslt).
The programs listed below may be used to process the exported XML file with one of these XSLT files to produce a <b>Password Safe</b> compatible XML file that can then be imported
to <b>Password Safe</b> <u>V3.26 or later</u>.</p>

<p>The XSLT files conform to V1.0 of XSLT as described in <a target="blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a> and have been tested with XML files created by KeePass V1.19b and KeePass V2.15.</p>

<p>Note that times in <b>Password Safe</b> must be earlier than
  January 19, 2038.  Any time later than this is currently
treated as invalid and that the associated field is unset.</p>

<p>Under Windows, the following XSLT processors support the supplied XSL Transform files. The example
command line execution of these processors assume:<p>
<ul>
<li>The style sheet to convert the KeePass XML file to a <b>Password Safe</b> XML file is: KPV1_to_PWS.xslt or
KPV2_to_PWS.xslt.</li>
<li>The input KeePass V1 or V2 XML file is: KeePassV1.xml or KeePassV2.xml</li>
<li>The output <b>Password Safe</b> XML file will be: PWS.xml</li>
<li>All input and output files are in the same directory as the XSLT processor. If not, you will need to
enter the full path of these files.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The command line program from Microsoft (XSLT Processor Version 4.0). The properties of the file msxsl.exe state that
it is V1.1.0.1 and dated 2001, although the web site states that it is
  V2.0 and dated 19 September 2004. It can currently be found at
<a target="blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=2fb55371-c94e-4373-b0e9-db4816552e41&displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads</a>.
It requires Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) V4.0 to be installed.  Whilst the latest MSXML version is V6, V4
is normally installed on all versions of Windows supported by <b>Password Safe</b>.
<p>For KeePass V1 XML file use the command:</p>
<pre>
msxsl KeePassV1.xml KPV1_to_PWS.xslt -o PWS.xml
</pre>
For KeePass V2 XML file use the command:
<pre>
msxsl KeePassV2.xml KPV2_to_PWS.xslt -o PWS.xml
</pre>
</li>
<li>AltovaXML Community Edition (current version 2011r3).
See <a target="blank" href="http://www.altova.com/altovaxml.html">
http://www.altova.com/altovaxml.html</a>.
<p>For KeePass V1 XML file use the command:</p>
<pre>
AltovaXML -xslt1 KPV1_to_PWS.xslt -in KeePassV1.xml -out PWS.xml
</pre>
For KeePass V2 XML file use the command:
<pre>
AltovaXML -xslt1 KPV2_to_PWS.xslt -in KeePassV2.xml -out PWS.xml
</pre>
</li>
<li>Saxon-HE (Home Edition) (current version 9.3.0.5).
See <a target="blank" href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/">http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.
There is also a graphical front-end for Saxon called Kernow.
See <a target="blank" href="http://kernowforsaxon.sourceforge.net/">http://kernowforsaxon.sourceforge.net/</a>.
The format of the command depends on whether you use the Java or .Net version of
Saxon-HE and/or Kernow.  Please refer to the product's documentation for further information.</li>
</ol>

<p>All these programs are free, although Kernow needs to be registered if used more than 100 times.</p>

<h4>KeePass V1 XML Special Processing</h4>

<ul>
<li>If a KeePass group contains a dot ('.'), it is converted to a forward slash ('/') when added to
<b>Password Safe</b>, since dots are used as group delimiters by <b>Password Safe</b>.</li>

<li>All 'carriage return' characters are removed from the Notes field and all 'newline' characters
are converted to the normal <b>Password Safe</b> delimiter '&raquo;' used to denote new lines within
the Notes field.</li>

<li>The KeePass entry's UUID will be transferred to the <b>Password Safe</b> entry unless it is already
used within that database (which is <em>very</em> unlikely), in which case a new value will be calculated during
import.</li>

<h4>KeePass V2 XML Special Processing</h4>

<ul>
<li>The '&lt;HistoryMaxItems&gt;' field from the '&lt;Meta&gt;' section of the KeePass V2 XML file
is used as the maximum number of passwords to be saved in an <b>Password Safe</b>'s entry password
history.  All other fields in this section are ignored.</li>

<li>If a KeePass group contains a dot ('.'), it is converted to a forward slash ('/') when added to
<b>Password Safe</b>, since dots are used as group delimiters by <b>to Password Safe</b>.</li>

<li>All 'carriage return' characters are removed from the Notes field and all 'newline' characters
are converted to the normal <b>Password Safe</b> delimiter '&raquo;' used to denote new lines within
the Notes field.</li>

<li>The KeePass entry's UUID will be transferred to the <b>Password Safe</b> entry unless it is already
used within that database (which is very unlikely), in which case a new value will be calculated during
import.</li>

<li>If the '&lt;DefaultAutoTypeSequence&gt;' field is present within a KeePass group is used
as the default <b>Password Safe</b> Autotype field for entries within that group.</li>

<li>If an entry's '&lt;Autotype&gt;' field is set to 'True' and the '&lt;DefaultSequence&gt;'
is not empty, then this is used as the <b>Password Safe</b>'s entry's Autotype sequence. If it is
'True' but '&lt;DefaultSequence&gt;' is empty, then the '&lt;DefaultAutoTypeSequence&gt;' field from 
the parent group is used as the <b>Password Safe</b>'s entry's Autotype sequence.</li>

<li>If the '&lt;OverrideURL&gt;' field is not empty, its value is inserted into the Notes field and
prefixed by "OverrideURL:" and the URL field is prefixed by "[alt]".</li>

<li>If the URL string begins with "\\" or "cmd://" (case insensitive) the field is placed in the
<b>Password Safe</b>'s entry's Run Command field and Placeholder substitution is performed (see below).
If neither of these prefixes appear in the URL string, it is placed in the <b>Password Safe</b>'s
entry's URL field with only {S:FieldName} substitution.</li>

<li>If the '&lt;Tags&gt;' field is not empty, its value is inserted into the Notes field and
prefixed by "Tags:".</li>
</ul>

<p>KeePass V2 exports all strings, e.g. Title, in a "String" section with "Key" and "Value" sub-elements.
For example:
<pre>
&lt;String&gt;
	&lt;Key&gt;Title&lt;/Key&gt;
	&lt;Value&gt;Test title&lt;/Value&gt;
&lt;/String&gt;
</pre>
<p>The following table shows the conversion of these to the <b>Password Save</b> equivalent XML
element.</p>

<p>KeePass V2 exports all date/time fields, e.g. creation time, in a "Times" section. For example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Times&gt;
  &lt;LastModificationTime&gt;2011-05-30T14:20:57Z&lt;/LastModificationTime&gt;
  &lt;CreationTime&gt;2011-05-27T18:09:29Z&lt;/CreationTime&gt;
