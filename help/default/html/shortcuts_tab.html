<h2>Shortcuts Tab</h2>

<img src="images/options/shortcuts_tab.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 512px;" alt="Shortcuts tab">

<p><b>Password Safe</b> allows you to define key sequences (shortcuts) that perform specific operations in the application. This tab allows you to control and review the shortcuts, as follows.</p>

<h3>Application Hot Key</h3>

<p>When checked, pressing the keys in the sequence to the right will
restore <b>Password Safe</b> from the system tray, if minimized, or bring it to
the front, if obscured by other applications.</p>

<h3>Autotype HotKey</h3>

<p>When checked, pressing the keys "Shift + Ctrl + T" will perform
Autotype into the selected field in another Window/application
as long as an entry in the database has been selected and the database is
not locked.  If you enable "Minimize after Autotype" in the
<a href="misc_tab.html">Misc Tab</a> and "Lock password database on minimize" 
in the <a href="security_tab.html">Security Tab</a>, you will have to unlock
the database after Autotype has been performed in order to use this hotkey again.</p>

<h3>HotKey In Use</h3>

<p>HotKeys can be defined and registered by any Windows application. However, Windows works on
a "first come, first served basis" so that if you run multiple instances of <b>Password Safe</b>
then the first instance started will get notified by Windows if its HotKey is used. In addition,
if another application has already registered your assigned HotKey before <b>Password Safe</b>
starts, then it will continue to 'own' it. HotKeys are released when the owning application
either unregisters it or ends but this will not automatically register it to another - there
is no "waiting list".   The image below is an example where a second instance of
<b>Password Safe</b> is started and both HotKeys are active.</p>

<h3>HotKey and Shortcut Conflicts</h3>

<p>Versions of <b>Password Safe</b> prior to 3.42 allowed HotKey and Shortcut values to be
defined for menu items even though they were already assigned to the application HotKey
or an entry. There were uncertainties as to which menu or entry would be selected on using
the shortcut.  From version 3.42, conflicts will not be able to be defined.</p>

<p>At start-up, <b>Password Safe</b> will check for conflicts and warn the user.  If a HotKey
has a conflict, it will be disabled.  The image below is an extreme example.</p>

<img src="images/hotkeys_conflict.jpg" alt="KotKey Conflict">

<p>When a database is opened, conflicts will also be detected and, in this case, any menu
shortcut that is also assigned to an entry will be temporarily removed.  Once the database is
closed, it will be reinstated.</p>

<h3>Program Shortcuts</h3>

<p>To change a shortcut (or add a new one), select the
row with the action you'd like to change, then click on the 'Shortcut
Key' field for that entry. Any key combination that you select will be
defined as the shortcut for this action. For example, to get the File
Properties dialog box to appear when Control, Alt and 'p' are pressed,
select the "File&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Properties" row, click on the 'Shortcut
Key' field, and then press the Control Alt and p key. The text
'Ctrl + Alt + P' will appear in the Shortcut Key field, and once you press
OK, the change will take effect. For more details on the keys that
can (and cannot) be defined as shortcuts, see <a href="Shortcut_Keys.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you can define shortcuts where there currently are
none, as well as replacing the defaults with those of your choosing.
The shortcuts will be stored in your preference file, and will be
available the next time you start <b>Password Safe</b>.</p>

<p>If you decide to remove a shortcut or revert to the default
shortcut for a given action, just select the desired 'Shortcut Key'
field and right-click. A popup menu will appear, allowing you to do so.
To revert <i>all</i> shortcuts to their default values, click on 'Reset All Program Shortcuts'.</p>

<h3>Database Entry Shortcuts</h3>
This table summarizes the shortcuts that are associated with specific entries in the currently opened database.
Entry-specific shortcuts are defined in the entry's <a href="entering_pwd_add.html">Additional tab</a>. To edit an entry-specific shortcut, double-click on the desired row.
This will display the corresponding entry's Edit dialog box.
