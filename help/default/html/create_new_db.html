<h2>Creating and Opening a Safe</h2>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> allows users to store all passwords in a single
"safe" (password database), or to create multiple databases for
different purposes (e.g., one for work, one for personal use).
Each database is independent and can be moved and used on different systems,
as long as the same version of <b>Password Safe</b> is installed. Databases are
encrypted with an encryption key derived from the master password (the master
password, however, is <b>not</b> kept in the database in any form).</p>

<p>If you are using <b>Password Safe</b> for the first time, press the
"New..." button. You will be asked to choose the name and location of
your password database (the default, "pwsafe.psafe3", is fine).
Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter a master password that
is used to encrypt and lock the contents of your new safe.</p>

<h3>Before You Begin</h3>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> works very hard to make sure you password
information is saved properly. However, <b>Password Safe</b> cannot
protect against physical damage or loss to your hard disk, laptop or PC.
Therefore, we strongly recommend that you make regular copies of your password
database 'off-line', that is, to another PC or disk. This can be done manually,
or by using a cloud storage service such as
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home">DropBox</a>,
<a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a> or
<a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">JungleDisk</a>, to name a few.</p>

<p>Another thing you might want to consider is arranging for access
to your password database by relatives or co-workers if you are no
longer able to do so. <b>Password Safe</b> has
<b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">no</span></b> 'back door'
or 'recovery password' mechanism by design. This means that you are
responsible for making the master key available to others under the
appropriate circumstances. This can be as simple as a sealed envelope
in a drawer or safe-deposit box, or a more elaborate mechanism such as
splitting the master password and giving different parts to different
parties.</p>

<h3>Create a New Database</h3>

<p>There are two ways that a new database can be created. By clicking
<b>New...</b> from the <b>Safe Combination Entry</b> dialog when the program
is started, or from the <b>"File&nbsp;?&nbsp;New..."</b> menu once
<b>Password Safe</b> has been opened. Using either method causes the
<b>Safe Combination Set Up</b> dialog to appear.</p>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will show the database
last used, and displays a combination prompt for it. If you use several databases,
drop-down list. Alternately, you can type in the path to the database
to open, or select it from a File dialog box by pressing on the
ellipsis ("...") button. Once a database is open, you can change to
another via the <b>Open...</b> command from the <b>File Menu</b>.</small>

<p>On checking the "Show Combination" box, the contents of old and new combination
will be visible in clear and the confirmation combination edit box is disabled as
no longer necessary.</p>

<h3>Using YubiKey with PasswordSafe</h3>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> can work with a <a href="about_pws_yubi.html">YubiKey</a>
device to provide "two factor authentication", that is, protecting your database
by both something you know (your "Safe Combination" or master passphrase),
and something you have (the YubiKey device). If you do not have a YubiKey device,
then the YubiKey-specific buttons and texts will not be displayed by <b>Password Safe</b>,
and the YubiKey-specific instructions below do not apply.</p>

<p>If your YubiKey is connected to your PC, then a "Yubikey" button and text
area will appear in the Safe Combination Entry and Setup windows, as show
above. This allows you to use your YubiKey to access your Password
Safe database, either in addition to, or instead of a "Safe Combination".
For maximum security, we recommend that your database be protected <b>both</b>
by your YubiKey and a Safe Combination (this is known as two-factor authentication).</p>

<h4>Setting up a Safe Combination with YubiKey</h4>

<p>To use your <a href="about_pws_yubi.html">configured</a> YubiKey to
protect your database:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you haven't already done so, insert your YubiKey into a USB slot on your PC.
The Yubikey button on the Safe Combination window will now become active, and the text
to the right of will change to "Click, then activate your YubiKey"</li>
<li>Set up the Safe Combination as follows:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>If you wish to protect your database using <b>both</b> your YubiKey and a
Safe Combination ("two factor authentication"), then <b>first</b> enter the
Safe Combination in the "Safe Combination" and "Verify" fields, <b>then</b> click
on the Yubikey button.</li>
<li>If you wish to protect your database using your YubiKey <b>only</b>, then
leave the "Safe Combination" and "Verify" fields <b>empty</b>, and click on
the Yubikey button.</li>
<li>Of course, you can also choose to protect the database by a Safe
Combination alone, just enter the Safe Combination in the "Safe Combination"
and "Verify" fields and then click on OK.</li>
</ol>
<li>Click on the Yubikey button. The "Click, then activate your YubiKey" will
be replaced by a progress bar indicating the remaining time you have to activate
your YubiKey (by touching the flashing green light on the device). If you do not
activate your YubiKey in the allotted time (about 15 seconds), then an
error message will be displayed, and you can try again or cancel.</li>
<li>Once the YubiKey has been activated, your <b>Password Safe</b> database
will be created.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Opening a database with YubiKey</h3>

<p>To open a Password Safe database protected with your Yubikey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the desired database is selected in the "Open Password Safe"
field. If it's not there, click on the ellipsis (...) and choose it.</li>
<li>If you've chosen to protect your database using <b>both</b> your YubiKey
and a Safe Combination, <b>first</b> enter the Safe Combination in the
"Open Password Safe" field, <b>then</b> click on the Yubikey button. If
you've chosen to protect your database using your YubiKey <b>only</b>,
then leave the "Open Password Safe" field <b>empty</b>, and click on the
Yubikey button.</li>
<li>When you click on the Yubikey button, the "Click, then activate your
YubiKey" will be replaced by a progress bar indicating the remaining time
you have to activate your YubiKey (by touching the flashing green light on
the device). If you do not activate your YubiKey in the allotted time (about 15
seconds), then an error message will be displayed, and you can
try again or cancel.</li>
<li>Once the YubiKey has been activated, your <b>Password Safe</b>
database will be opened.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Virtual keyboard</h3>

<p>To setup a master password in a secure way, you could use accented
characters (e.g. on a German keyboard) such as <b>&uuml;</b>, <b>&szlig;</b>
or similar. To realize the input of such characters, you would
need a foreign keyboard. Such a keyboard is available as a virtual
keyboard. This keyboard is then used to simulate all available foreign characters.
The virtual keyboard can be shown
by clicking on the <span><img alt="Symbol virtual keyboard" src="images/vk_small.jpg">
</span>symbol. Foreign characters, that are not available at the physical
keyboard, can be put in in this way. So you can build your desired master password.
Even pieces of the master password can be built this way.</p>
