<h2>System Tab</h2>

<img alt="system tab" src="images/options/system_tab.jpg">

<p>The System Tab provides access to settings that are related to
Password Safe's interaction with the system on which it is running.</p>

<h3>Put icon in System Tray</h3>

<p>If checked, <b>Password Safe</b> will minimize to
the System Tray area. If unchecked, the program will minimize to
the task bar.</p>

<p>The icon in the system tray indicates whether the password database is locked
(<img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="locked" src="images/locked_tray.jpg">)
or unlocked (<img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="unlocked" src="images/unlocked_tray.jpg">).
If it is locked, you will be prompted for the master combination when you
try to restore it.</p>

<h3>Remember last <i>N</i> used entries in System Tray menu</h3>

<p>If the <b>Put icon in System Tray</b> option is enabled, you can right-click
on the system tray icon to get to the most recently used entries
directly, without going through the application's main screen. This
option allows you to configure how many recent entries you wish to
keep in the system tray icon's list.  NOTE: This list is saved in the database 
only when a read/write database is saved or closed.</p>

<h3>Hide System Tray icon (Hot Key MUST be active)</h3>

<p>If checked, this will cause <b>Password Safe</b> to hide his icon in the
system tray. This functionality will only be enabled if the Hot Key to start
or reopen <b>Password Safe</b> is active.</p>

<h3>Start Password Safe at Login</h3>

<p>If checked, this will cause <b>Password Safe</b> to start automatically in the
System tray when you log on. Note that you will be prompted for the
Safe combination the first time you double-click on the System Tray
icon, <b>not before</b>.</p>

<h3>Recent <b>Password Safe</b> Databases</h3>

<p>These controls allow you to configure how many
recently opened databases are displayed in the File menu. Note that
you need to exit and restart <b>Password Safe</b> for changes in
this control to take effect.</p>

<h3>Recent Databases on File Menu rather than as a sub-menu</h3>

<p>This option determines how the recently opened databases are presented
in the File menu - directly on the menu, or as a sub-menu.</p>

<h3>Open database read-only by default</h3>

<p>Setting this option will cause <b>Password Safe</b> to open databases 
in read-only mode by default. This may be useful in a multi-user environment, as by default
<b>Password Safe</b> allows write access to the first person who opens the database, and
restricts others to read-only mode. With this option, you can determine
by site policy who will have write-access to a given database.

<h3>Allow multiple instances (requires all instances to be restarted)</h3>

<h3>Remove Password Safe data from Registry</h3>

<p>Prior to version 3.05, <b>Password Safe</b>
used the Registry to store configuration data, such as non-default
options settings, last database opened, etc. As of this release, this
information is split into database-specific and user/machine specific
settings, with the latter being stored in a separate configuration
file. Selecting this option and clicking on the <b>Apply</b> button
will cause the registry settings to be cleared. This is useful if you
wish to remove traces of <b>Password Safe</b> on your PC. Note, however,
that this means that older versions of <b>Password Safe</b> will revert
to default value for some of the settings.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>If previous versions of <b>Password Safe</b> have never been installed,
or if the data has already been removed, then the checkbox and <b>Apply</b>
button will not be displayed.</li>
<li>In rare circumstances, where <b>Password Safe</b> is unable to create or write
to the configuration file, the registry will be used.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3>Migrate <b>Password Safe</b> configuration to user directory</h3>

<p>Prior to version 3.22, <b>Password Safe</b> kept application preferences (such as some
of the user options, last files opened, window size and location, etc.)
in a file in the same directory as the <b>Password Safe</b> executable. This
has caused problems with recent versions of Windows when users were not
given write access to this directory. Therefore, as of version 3.22,
the configuration file (pwsafe.cfg) will be created in the standard
location for such files (in the user's 'Application Data' directory).<br>

<p>By default, upgrades to existing installations will not change the
existing preference file ("if it ain't broke, don't fix it"). However,
if a user wishes to switch to the new setting manually, selecting this
checkbox and clicking on 'Apply' will do so.</p>

<p>In more detail: The configuration file is designed to support multiple users from multiple
machines. The migration function will move the current user's settings
(associated with the current PC) from the configuration file to the new
location. If there are other user/machine specific configurations in
the file, they will be left untouched. If, on the other hand, there are
none left after migration, the empty file will be deleted.</p>

<p>If you wish to share a common configuration file between users and/or across
different PCs, you can either keep the file in the executable
directory, or specify its location explicitly using the '-g <i>config-file</i>'
option, as described in <a href="cli.html">command line arguments</a>.
