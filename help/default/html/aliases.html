<h2>Password Aliases</h2>

<p>If you're using a "single sign-on" system that allows you to share
the same password across different machines/servers/applications, etc.
you can setup <b>Password Safe</b>
entries accordingly, so that changing one password affects all other
related entries. This is called "aliasing" entries. This section describes how
to define and use such aliases.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The basic idea is to allow one entry's password to be referred to
by another. The "referred to" entry is called the <b>base</b>, and the
"referring" entry (or entries) is (are) called the <b>alias(es)</b>.
When an entry is set to be the alias of another entry, the alias's
password effectively "follows" that entry's password: If you copy the
alias' password to the clipboard, the password that gets copied is
the base's. If you change the base's password, this is immediately
reflected in all the alias entries associated with the base. Although
this may sound complicated, in fact it's quite simple and intuitive to
use. The hardest part is setting up the aliases, as described below.</p>

<h4>Defining an alias</h4>

<p>In <b>Password Safe</b>, an entry can refer to another's password by means
of a specially formatted password in the referring entry. The format is
the "name" of the referred-to entry enclosed in square brackets. Most
of the time, you can think of "name" as synonymous with the title field
of an entry, so if the base entry's title is "master", for example,
then entering "[master]" (without the quotes) in another entry's
password field is enough to define the other entry as an alias of
"master".</p>

<p>In the general case, a "name" can contain all of the following fields,
separated by colons: Group, Title and User name. Note that if the title
is unique in the database, then the other fields are optional. Likewise,
if the group and title together or title and user together specify a unique
entry, then the corresponding user or group doesn't have to be specified.</p>


<p>In <b>Password Safe</b> entries, only the Title and Password fields are
mandatory.  Group and User name fields are optional as long as the resulting 
combination of "group/title/user&nbsp;name" is unique. As indicated above, the
alias' "password" is in the form [g:t:u] but
in fact you only have to specify enough information to uniquely identify
the base entry.  So, if there is only one entry in the database with title 't',
then [t] would be sufficient - since title is mandatory and only one item is given,
it is assumed to be the title.  If there were more than one entry with this title,
you would be warned that this is the case, and you would need to be more specific in order to
uniquely identify the base entry by adding either its group, its user name, or both.
As long as there is a matching unique entry, any of
the following formats are accepted: [g:t:u], [g:t], [t:u] or [t].  Specifying a
colon without a value implies an empty field, e.g. [g:t:] means an entry with
title 't' in group 'g' and with no user name value and [:t:] specifies an entry with
title 't' in the root with no user name value, etc.</p>

<p>If you change the password of an Alias (either via the Generate password button or
by typing in the password field), the change will only be 
made when the Apply or OK button is clicked. However, if you wish to change
the base entry's password, then you should edit the base entry directly.
If you change the Alias's password from [g:t:u] 
to some other value not in this format, it will change from an alias to a "normal" entry, and will have 
no relation to the previous base entry. Of course, 
you can restore the connection by Undo, or manually editing the password.</p>

<p>Unlike shortcuts, which refer to the base entry for <u>all</u> fields, aliases 
have their own values for all fields <u>except</u> for its password, which is its
base's.  For example: copying the aliases URL will use the alias's value but 
copying the alias's password will copy its base's.</p>

<p>Finally, if a normal entry was saving its password history before it was made an alias by
changing its password as described above, then it will retain this history.  If the
alias is then reverted back to a normal entry at a later date, this password history
will again become active and be updated if its password is changed.</p>

<p>The following examples should make this clear.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ol>
<li>If the base entry's title is "LDAP Server", and there are no
other entries with that title, then an alias can be defined by an
entry that has "[LDAP Server]" in the password field.</li>
<li>If there are "LDAP Server" entries in two different groups, say
"Dept. A" and "Dept. B", then one can specify an alias to the latter by
"[Dept. A:LDAP Server]". Note you do not have to specify the user name if
the information you have provided uniquely identifies the base entry.</li>
<li>Different user names can also be used to differentiate between
similar base entries, e.g., "[LDAP Server:Joe]" and "[LDAP Server:Mary]".</li>
<li>Finally, all three fields may be specified, as in "[Dept. A:LDAP Server:Joe]"</li>
</ol>

<h4>Display</h4>

<p>Base entries, that is, entries with at least one alias "pointing" to
them, are displayed with a green triangle instead of a green square in
the nested tree view.</p>

<p>Alias entries are shown with grey triangles.</p>
