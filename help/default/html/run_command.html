<h1>Run Command</h1>


<p>An entry's&nbsp;'Run Command'&nbsp;field can contain a command that will
be run when the Run Command action is selected. The command can be anthing
that you can type in the Start-&gt;Run box of your computer.</p>


<p>In addition Password Safe is able to pass arguments to the command
such as the entry's username, password, etc., as described below. This
allows you to 'program' fairly complex actions, such as invoking a
remote access program and passing it the username and password
associated with the entry.</p>


<p>In general, 'variables' are replaced with values associatedwith them
before being passed to the computer for execution. The dollar ('$')
sign is used to indicate a variable.</p>


<ul>

  <li>Variables are specified as '$name' and <i>are case sensitive</i>. Variable names always start with an
alphabetic character and the remaining characters are alphanumeric. The variable name is 
terminated either by encountering a non-alphanumeric character or the end of the Run Command.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>To use a variable immediately followed by an alphanumeric character in the Run Command, enclose the variable's name in
curly brackets e.g., '${varname}string'.</li>


    <li>To use a '$' in the
string as normal text and not indicating that the following text is a variable
name, escape it using a back-slash ('\') e.g. '\$text' becomes '$text' and is
not treated as a variable called 'text'.</li>


    <li>To use a back-slash before a '$' as a back-slash, escape it with a back-slash e.g. '\\$name'
becomes '\$name' in the resulting text and '$name' is treated as a variable. A
back-slash does not have to be escaped unless it precedes a '$' indicating a
following variable.</li>
    <li>A variable may be followed by&nbsp;a numerical value within square brackets is called an 'Index
value'. The Index value 'n' can be preceded by '+' or '-' e.g.
[-2] or [2] or [+2]. Password Safe treats an index that equates to zero as
meaning the complete field.

    <p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to add quotes around your string if required e.g., if your
database directory contains spaces, to access a text file in it based on your
open database name, you would need the following (with quotes):<br>

'$dbdir\\$dbname.txt'<br>

Notice that the back-slash is escaped so that the '$dbname' is recognised as a
variable.</p>


    <p>On Windows, the normal substitution of environmental variables
(specified as %variable_name%) is performed. For example:
'%windir%\notepad.exe' could become (depending on your installation)
'C:\Windows\notepad.exe'. Current values set in your environment can
be determined by running 'cmd.exe' and issuing the 'set' command without any 
parameters. Any unknown environmental variable is left unchanged in the 
Run Command e.g., %xyz%\notepad.exe remains as %xyz%\notepad.exe if
variable 'xyz' is not set. Note: Windows environmental variables are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> 
case sensitive.</p>
