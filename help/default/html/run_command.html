<h1>Run Command</h1>

<p>An entry's 'Run Command' field can contain a command that will
be run when the Run Command action is selected. Anything that you can do in Windows' "Start&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Run" can be used here.</p>

<p>In addition, <b>Password Safe</b> is able to pass arguments to the command
such as the entry's username, password, etc., as described below. This
allows you to 'program' fairly complex actions, such as invoking a remote access program 
(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>,
for example) and passing it the username and password associated with the entry.</p>

<p>In general, 'variables' are replaced with values associated with them
before being passed to the computer for execution. The dollar ('$')
sign is used to indicate a variable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Variables are specified as '$name' and <i>are case sensitive</i>. Variable names always start with an
alphabetic character and the remaining characters are alphanumeric. The variable name is
terminated either by encountering a non-alphanumeric character (such as a space) or the end of the Run Command.</li>
<ul>

<li>To use a variable immediately followed by an alphanumeric character in the Run Command, enclose the variable's name in curly brackets e.g., '${varname}string'.</li>

<li>To use a '$' in the string as normal text (not indicating that the following text is a variable
name), escape it using a back-slash ('\') e.g., '\$text' becomes '$text' and is
not treated as a variable called 'text'.</li>

<li>To use a back-slash before a '$' as a back-slash, escape it with a back-slash e.g. '\\$name'
becomes '\$name' in the resulting text and '$name' is treated as a variable. A
back-slash does not have to be escaped unless it precedes a '$' indicating a
following variable.</li>

<li>A variable may be followed by a numerical value within square brackets is called an 'Index
value'. The index value 'n' can be preceded by '+' or '-' e.g.
[-2] or [2] or [+2]. <b>Password Safe</b> treats an index
that equates to zero as meaning the entire field.
</li>

Autotype will be performed once the target window is active. The variable and
its value, if present, will be removed from the string that is executed. This
variable can appear anywhere in the Run Command as it only specifies what
<b>Password Safe</b> will do after the command string has been executed. Unlike other variables,
this one will be able to take a value to override the entry's current
value. The format is as follows ('$autotype' can replace '$a' in the
following examples):<br>

<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<colgroup><col width="20%"><col width="80%"></colgroup>
<tbody>

</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to add quotes around your string if required e.g., if your
database directory contains spaces, to access a text file in it based on your
open database name, you would need the following (with quotes):</p>
<pre>
'$dbdir\\$dbname.txt'
</pre>
<p>Notice that the backslash is escaped so that the '$dbname' is recognised as a
variable.</p>

<p>On Windows, the normal substitution of environment variables
(specified as %variable_name%) is performed. For example:
'%windir%\notepad.exe' could become (depending on your installation)
'C:\Windows\notepad.exe'. Current values set in your environment can
be determined by running 'cmd.exe' and issuing the 'set' command without any
parameters. Any unknown environment variable is left unchanged in the
Run Command e.g., %xyz%\notepad.exe remains as %xyz%\notepad.exe if
variable 'xyz' is not set. <b>Note:</b> Windows environment variables are <b>not</b>
case sensitive.</p>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following Run Command will cause the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/" target="_blank">Putty</a>
program to connect to myHost giving the entry's username and password:
<pre>
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\putty.exe" -ssh ${u}@myHost 22 -pw $p
</pre>
</li>
<li>This will open a new instance of <b>Password Safe</b> with the specified database (Thanks to Dave for this one):
<pre> ${autotype}(\p\n)"${appdir}\pwsafe.exe" \UNC\path\to\database.psafe3</pre></li>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;System "Allow multiple instances" is checked for this to work</li>
<li>You might also want to set the Double-Click Action for this entry to "Run Command"</li>
</ul>
