<h2>Backups Tab</h2>

<img alt="backups tab" src="images/options/backups_tab.jpg">
 <p>The Backups Tab allows you to configure how automatic backups are 
created and managed.</p> 

<h3>Save database immediately after Edit or Add</h3> 

<p>When Checked, the database will be saved if there is any change
  e.g. add, delete, duplicate, edit or rename of an entry or group as
  well as if any entries/groups are added/moved via import or Drag &amp;
  Drop. When this is used, enabling "Create intermediate backups" is
  recommended, as this helps protect against disk problems. <br>
  Note that changes made via the Compare database results dialog
  will <em>not</em> cause a database save for each action, but only
  after the compare results dialog has been closed.</p>

<h3>Create intermediate backups (.ibak) before saving</h3> 

<p>When checked, <b>Password Safe</b> will copy the database before each 
save. The names and location of the backup copies are defined in the 
following fields, as well as how many previous copies will be kept.</p> 

<h3>Backup Name</h3> 

<p>The names of the backup files consist of <b>Base</b> (by default, the 
name of the database without the .psafe3 extension), and <b>Suffix</b> 
(none, a running count, or the date/time of the backup). Here you can 
configure what the backups will be named, and how many will be saved. 
<b>Password Safe</b> will automatically erase the oldest databases 
beyond the number of backups that you specified. Note that Password Safe 
will only erase old databases if the suffix is an incremented number 
(running count).</p> 

<h3>Backup Directory</h3>

<p>By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will store the backups in the same 
directory as the currently open database. In this field you can specify 
an alternate location, such as a special backup directory, network 
drive, disk-on-key, etc. Of course, you must have write permission to 
the location you specify.</p>

<p>You may also use environment variables in defining the alternate location
for example: "<code>%homedrive%%homepath%\Documents\PWS Backups\</code>".  If you use these
variables, the expanded path will be shown underneath once you navigate to a different
control on this tab.</p>
