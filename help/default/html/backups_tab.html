<h2>Backups Tab</h2>

<img alt="backups tab" src="images/options/backups_tab.jpg">
 <p>The Backups Tab allows you to configure how automatic backups are 
created and managed.</p> 

<h3>Save database immediately after Edit or Add</h3> 

<p>When checked, <b>Password Safe</b> saves all changes made to a 
password entry immediately, without waiting for the user to use 
<b>Save</b> or <b>Save As</b> and without confirmation.</p> 

<h3>Create intermediate backups (.ibak) before saving</h3> 

<p>When checked, <b>Password Safe</b> will copy the database before each 
save. The names and location of the backup copies are defined in the 
following fields, as well as how many previous copies should be kept.</p> 

<h3>Backup Name</h3> 

<p>The names of the backup files consist of <b>Base</b> (by default, the 
name of the database without the .psafe3 extension), and <b>Suffix</b> 
(none, a running count, or the date/time of the backup). Here you can 
configure what the backups will be named, and how many will be saved 
(<b>Password Safe</b> will automatically erase the oldest databases 
beyond the number of backups that you specified. Note that Password Safe 
will only erase old databases if the suffix is an incremented number 
(running count).</p> 

<h3>Backup Directory</h3>

<p>By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will store the backups in the same 
directory as the currently open database. In this field you can specify 
an alternate location, such as a special backup directory, network 
drive, disk-on-key, etc. Of course, you must have write permission to 
the location you specify.</p>
