<h2>User Names, Passwords, and Groups: Additional</h2>

<p>Username, passwords and groups together with the additional parameters are managed in 4 tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd.html">Basic</a></i>:</b> all necessary elements for password management</li>
<li><b><i>Additional</i>:</b> additional specifications, including history</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_date.html">Dates and Times</a></i>:</b> expiry and statistics</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_pp.html">Password Policy</a></i>:</b> specific differences to the default</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Additional</i> Tab</h3>

<img alt="Edit/View Additional" src="images/edit_view_entry_add.jpg"><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Autotype:</b> If this field is not empty, then its content replaces the
default value for the Autotype function (which is displayed above and comes from
either the <b>Password Safe</b> default or this database's default as set via the
<a href="misc_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Misc."</a>
tab). For more information, see the <a href="autotype.html">"Autotype"</a> help topic.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Run Cmd:</b> This field can be used to specify a command or program
to be run via the 'Run Command' action (via the Edit menu, right-click popup
menu or Ctrl-R). <b>Password Safe</b> is able to pass arguments to the command
such as the entry's username, password, etc., as described <a href="run_command.html">here</a>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Double click and Shift-Double click on entry:</b> This allows you to define what action
<b>Password Safe</b> will take when
you double-click, or double-click with Shift depressed, on an
entry. The default is to copy the entry's password and username to the
clipboard for double-click and shift + double-click, respectively. The
default actions are set in
<a href="misc_tab.html">Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Misc.</a> tab,
and marked with "(default)" in the drop-down lists.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Password History:</b> It is possible to configure <b>Password Safe</b>
to save the last few passwords of an entry. This can be done either when the entry is created,
or when viewing an existing entry. You see the recent passwords associated
with the entry. You can change the number of recent passwords that are kept.
For more information see the Password History page <a href="password_history.html">here</a>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Keyboard Shortcut:</b>
Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned to an entry and allow that entry to be immediately
selected irrespective of the current display of the database by pressing the appropriate
keystrokes.<br><br>
<blockquote>
<i>Additional notes on entry keyboard shortcuts:</i>
<ul>
<li>Entry Keyboard Shortcuts are stored as part of the entry's record in the database.
However, <b>Password Safe</b> also has keyboard shortcuts defined that correspond
to its menu items.  The scope of the menu item shortcuts is for all databases opened by
a given user on a particular PC and can be customised by that user
(Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options, <a href="shortcuts_tab.html">Shortcuts tab</a>) and may change according to the user selected
application language e.g. English, German etc.</li>

<li>Therefore, although a warning is shown if you select an entry keyboard shortcut that
is currently assigned to a menu item, there may not be a conflict if you later
customise the menu shortcuts or change the application display language.  Similarly,
an entry keyboard shortcut may not be in use when added to an entry but could become
conflicted if you later customises the menu shortcuts or changes the language.</li>

<li>As entry keyboard shortcuts cannot change the database when used, unlike say a menu item
shortcut that could delete an entry, as a safety measure, entry keyboard shortcuts take precedence over menu item shortcuts.</li>

<li>An entry keyboard shortcut must include the Alt or Ctrl key (with or without the Shift key).
If one of these is not included when entering a value, all combinations of the Alt, Ctrl and Shift
keys are tried in the order (Alt; Alt + Shift; Ctrl; Ctrl + Shift, Alt + Ctrl; Alt + Ctrl + Shift) to
achieve a unique combination. For example, if the user specifies "Shift + 6", the shortcut could be
changed to "Alt + Shift + 6". However, if you specify, for example, "Ctrl + 6" it will not be altered.</li>

<li>The keyboard shortcut will be removed from an entry if it is already
assigned to another entry in the database, in the following cases:
<ul>
<li>If an entry is imported (via text or XML). Note: This will also be noted in the Import
report.</li>

<li>If an entry is added during a database merge. Note: This will also be noted in the Merge
report.</li>

<li>If an entry is "Dragged & Dropped" into the database from another database.  This will
not be the case if an entry is dragged within the same database.</li>

<li>If entries are copied to the database via the results of a database Compare dialog.</li>

<li>Any entry created via "Duplicate Group" or "Duplicate Entry" actions.</li>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>A list of currently in use entry keyboard shortcuts will be displayed below the <b>Password Safe</b>
program related menu shortcuts on the OptionsShortcuts tab via
<a href="shortcuts_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Shortcuts"</a>.
You may double click on the keyboard shortcut in this list to Edit/View the corresponding entry.
You may also add the entry keyboard shortcut column to the Flattened List view and/or create a
filter to just show those entries with or without keyboard shortcuts.</p>
