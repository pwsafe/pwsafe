<h2>Exporting Entries</h2>
<p><b>Password Safe</b> supports exporting (and importing)
of the stored passwords to (and from) various formats. To export
password entries use the "File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Export To" menu.
The supported formats are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Password Safe v1 (for use by versions 1.x of Password Safe)</li>
<li>Password Safe v2 (for use by versions 2.x of Password Safe)</li>
<li><a href="#text">Plain text</a></li>
<li><a href="#xml">XML</a></li>
<li><a href="#subset">Subsets of the database</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For previous versions of <b>Password Safe</b>, just select the desired
format and specify the name of the database file you wish to create.</p>

<p>In addition, to 'export' a subset of entries to another Password
Safe database, just start <b>Password Safe</b> (assuming you permit multiple
instances via
<a href="system_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;System"</a>
tab) and create a new database, whilst having your normal database
open in another instance. Then you can simply drag and drop any entries or groups from your
open database to this 'export' database.</p>

<p>Export uses a Wizard interface. You may also select the Advanced
field selection in order to restrict which entries you export and which
field of these entries you export from your current database.
See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>A report of the actions taken will be available on completion and this may be copied
to the clipboard or saved to disk as a text file in the same directory as the database.
The <a href="view_menu.html">"View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Reports"</a> menu item may then be
used to view the reports at a later date. The name of the report file is fixed and
dependent on the function that created it. If the same function is repeated
and its report saved to disk, any existing report for this function will be
overwritten. <span style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The report may contain sensitive data and
care should be taken when selecting the "save to disk" option.</span></p>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> allows you to export password entries to text files.
These files may then be used or modified by other applications.</p>
<p>You will be asked to enter the master password (safe combination)
to confirm that you may export the database into a clear text
unencrypted file before you can export its contents. If you're
using YubiKey authentication, click on the Yubikey button, then
activate your YubiKey. You will also be required to supply the
name of the new file and to confirm overwriting of it if a file of
the same name if it already exists in the directory you specified.</p>

<img alt="Export Text" src="images/export.jpg">

<p><small><b>Note:</b> If you do not have a <a href="about_pws_yubi.html">YubiKey</a>,
the screen shown above will not have the YubiKey button and text displayed.</small></p>

<p>You can also specify some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password entries will be exported with a tab character between
fields i.e., between the Group.Title, Username, Password and the
Notes fields. The "Group.Title" is considered a single field.
Any field containing a blank will be output inside double
quotation characters. Only the Notes field can contain multiple
line entries. The normal processing is to place each Notes line
on a separate line in the exported text field. However, this
makes it difficult to sort or to use when comparing two
different export files. To overcome this, you may specify a
delimiter to separate multiple lines when exporting them. If you
are going to import a text file created with such a delimiter,
then it must be specified, all the Notes lines will appear as
one single line in the resulting database.<br>
If required, tick that you want to put all separate lines
in the Notes field onto one line and enter the character to be used as
the delimiter. Since the whole Notes field is enclosed between double
quotation marks, this character is prohibited from being selected as
the multi-line delimiter.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Advanced Text Export Options" src="images/export_text_adv.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting "Advanced field selection" will display this Wizard page
to allow you to export only some of the entries, based on the text in
specified fields, and/or specify which fields are to be exported.
See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for more details.</p>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> Details on the format of the exported text file may be found in the
"<a href="imp_exp_text_details.html">Plain Text Export &amp; Import Format</a>" section.</small>
<hr>

<h3><a name="xml"></a>XML</h3>

<p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a popular format for transferring
data between applications. <b>Password Safe</b> can export (and import) the
database entries to this format. The structure (or <i>schema</i>)
against which the data is exported and validated is defined in the
file <i>pwsafe.xsd</i>, which is provided as part of the distribution. This file is used
by <b>Password Safe</b> when XML data is imported, and should be provided to
applications that wish to use the exported data.</p>

<hr>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
<b>Note:</b> The exported text is an unprotected copy of the specified password
entries. Deleting this copy after use is <b>not</b> sufficient for making it

<hr>

<p>The display of XML files is specified by <i>pwsafe.xsl</i>
- an eXtensible Stylesheet Language file. A sample file, which may be
modified for your own needs, is supplied as part of the distribution.
This file is only an example and you can easily modify it to display
whatever fields you want to show. As this only displays the data
and will not alter it, you will still be able to import it into
<b>Password Safe</b> at some later time.</p>

<p>As in the Text Export option, you can control what entries and field to
export to the XML file by selecting the "Advanced field selection".
This will display the following Wizard page:</p>

<p><img alt="Advanced XML Export Options" src="images/export_xml_adv.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting "Advanced field selection" will display this Wizard page
to allow you to export only some of the entries, based on the text in
specified fields, and/or specify which fields are to be exported. <b>Note:</b>
that the XML schema <u>requires</u> the Title and Password fields, hence these
cannot be deselected. See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for
more details.</p>

<h3><a name="subset"></a>Subsets of the database</h3>

<p>It is also possible to export a single entry or the members of a group to Plain Text,
XML or to a current version of a <b>Password Safe</b>.  In this case, right-click on
the entry of group and select the form of output from the "Export Entry To" or
"Export Group To" menu.</p>

<p>For Text and XML export, the options available are exactly the same as exporting the
complete database above.</p>

<p>Lastly, if a filter is active, it is possible to export the entries that satisfy 
this filter to a current version of a <b>Password Safe</b>. This can also be found on
the main "Export To" menu off the File menu.</p>

<p><u>Notes:</u>
<ol>
<li>When exporting only members of a group or the results of the current filter,
if any of the included entries are aliases or shortcuts, then the associated base entries
will also be exported even if it is not in the group or filtered results. This ensures that
the resulting exported file is consistent.</li>
<li>When exporting a single entry:</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>If the entry is an alias, the password of the exported entry will be that of its
base entry.</li>
<li>If the entry  is a shortcut, then only its base entry will be exported.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
