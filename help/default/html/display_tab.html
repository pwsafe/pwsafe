<h2>Display Tab</h2>

<img src="images/options/display_tab.jpg" alt="Display Tab">
<p>Functions within the <b>Display Tab</b> control how <b>Password Safe</b>
and password items are displayed.</p>

<h3>Always keep Password Safe on top</h3>

<p>If checked, maximized <b>Password Safe</b> will
always be the top most window displayed in the monitor, regardless of
what other window may have focus.</p>

<h3>Show Username in Tree View</h3>

<p>If checked, usernames will be displayed in square brackets following the item's name in the
<b>Nested Tree</b> view.</p>

<h3>Show Password in Tree View</h3>

<p>If checked, passwords will be displayed in curly braces following the user's name in the
<b>Nested Tree</b> view. <i>However, this option is <b>strongly</b> discouraged
in environments where passers-by can view the monitor.</i></p>

<h3>Show Notes as ToolTips in Tree &amp; List Views</h3>
<p>If checked, notes to an hovered item will be shown.</p>

<h3>Show password in Add &amp; Edit</h3>

<p>If checked, passwords that would be hidden in the <b>Add Entry and Edit/View Entry</b>
dialogs will be visible by default. You can display or hide the password for a
specific entry by clicking on the "Show/Hide" button in the dialog.</p>

<h3>Show Notes in Edit</h3>

<p>If checked, notes will be displayed by default in edit dialog. If not,
you will need to click on the Notes field in order to view the text
there.</p>

<h3>Word Wrap Notes in Add &amp; Edit</h3>

<p>If checked, the words will automatically be wrapped in the window, without an horizontal scroll bar. 
If not checked, an horizontal scroll bar will appear, if necessary.</p>

<h3>Show Grid Lines in List View</h3>

<p>If checked, a light grid line will be shown in the display list, making it look like a spreadsheet.</p>

<h3>Put Groups first in Tree View</h3>

<p>By default, your entries are displayed in strict alphabetical order in
the tree view. When this option is selected, all the groups will be
displayed first (in alphabetical order), followed by all top-level
entries.</p>

<h3>Highlight changed entries</h3>

<p>As long as entries are not saved, they will be shown highlighted.
If you checked "Save database immediately after Edit or Add" in the Backup tab,
entries will never be highlighted, because they get saved immediately.</p>

<h3>Warn <i>N</i> days before password expires</h3>

<p>If checked, <b>Password Safe</b> will scan all entries when reading a database
(typically when starting up), and display a list of the whose
expiration date is <i>N</i> days or less from the current date.</p>

<h3>Initial tree view</h3>

<p>This determines how your entries will be displayed in the tree view
when you open the database.</p>

<h3>Window Transparency</h3>

<p>The default is disabled. Onced enabled, <b>Password Safe</b> must be restarted
for it to take effect and for a value to be set.</p>

<p>If enabled, the value specified is the percentage of Window transparency.
0% means normal fully opaque and 100% is totally transparent and invisible.
Values greater than 50% are not supported. Note: This only applies to the main
dialog window. All other dialogs, message boxes and menus will always be fully opaque.</p>

<p>It is suggested that a value between 20% and 40% may be most beneficial.</p>
