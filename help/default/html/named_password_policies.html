<h2>Named Password Policies</h2>

<p><b>PasswordSafe</b> V3.28 and later provide the facility to create and manage
<b>Named Password Policies</b> via the "Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Password Policies..."
menu item.  These are database specific and are stored in the database header.  This
menu also replaces the setting of the database defaults via the
"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options" menu item.</p>

<img alt="Named Password Policies dialog" src="images/manage_password_policies.jpg">

<p>Via this dialog, one can edit the current database default password policy and
create, edit or delete any new "Named" policies.  Also, you cannot delete a named
policy that is being used by at least one entry in the database.  After selecting a
policy, its details will be shown below.  You can also List the entries referencing
a Named Password Policy by clicking on the List button and then go back to its details
by clicking on the Details button.  If the list of entries is displayed, you can double
click on an entry to edit/view it.</p>

<h3>Change Database's Default Password Policy</h3>

<p>When the database's default policy is selected, you may use the Edit button to
change its values.  The following dialog is shown.</p>

<h3>Add a New Named Password Policy</h3>

<p>By selecting the New button, the following dialog is used to add a new
Named Password Policy. The initial values are taken from the current database's
default password policy. In addition to the normal checks on the consistency of the
information you enter, you must also provide a unique name (within this database)
for this policy. <b>Note:</b> The name cannot exceed 255 characters in length.</p>

<h3>Edit an Existing Named Password Policy</h3>

<p>When a Named Password Policy is selected, you may use the Edit button to
change its values and the following dialog is shown. You may not change the name
of an existing Named Password Policy.</p>
<img alt="Edit a named password policies dialog" src="images/edit_named_policy.jpg">

<h3>Add/Edit entry and the Generate Password functions</h3>

<p>The Add/Edit entry function and the "Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Generate Password"
function have both been updated to allow an entry to use a named policy or to allow
the generation of a random password using a Named policy.  One reason to keep unused
Named Password Policies is to allow them to be used only to generate random passwords.</p>

<h3>Testing a Password Policy</h3>

<p>You may select the default or any defined Named Password Policy and click the Test button
to create a random password using its rules.  You may also then copy this to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Read-Only Databases</h3>

<p>If the database is in read-only mode, you may not add a new Named Password Policy, edit
the database default policy or an existing Named Password Policy nor delete an unused
Named Password Policy.  You may, however, View both the default and other policies. Any
changes made to this policy whilst viewing will not be saved.</p>

<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>

<p>You may use the Undo and Redo buttons (or the shortcuts Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y [or the
equivalent ones if you have changed them via the "Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options"
Shortcut property page]) to Undo any changes you have made on this dialog e.g. changed
the policy values of the database default policy or a Named Password Policy, added a new
or deleted an unused Named Password Policy.  If you have undone a change, you can Redo
it as long as you have not made another change in between.  Changes are not saved in the
database until you press OK to exit this dialog.</p>


<h2>XML and Text Import/Export</h2>

<p> When a database is exported to XML (whether it is a specific subset of the
entries in the database or the whole database), <u>all</u> the <b>Named Password
Policies</b> in the current database are also exported.  During the subsequent import of
that XML file, all the <b>Named Password Policies</b> are also imported into the current
database.  If a Named Password Policy of the same name already exists in
the current database and it has the same policy settings as that being imported, then it
will be used by any entries referencing it when they are imported.  However, if the
imported Named Password Policy has different policy settings to that in the
database with the same name, then the policy will be imported with the words
"Imported - <i>datetime</i>" appended to its name (where the '<i>datetime</i>' is the
date/time of the Import) and all imported entries referring to it will now reference
the newly named policy.</p>

<p>When importing a XML file, if the any record references a Named Password
Policy that does not exist in the current database (or in the XML file being imported),
then the entry will be changed to use the current database default policy.  Warning messages
will be placed in the Import log show which entries have been affected.</p>

<p>When exporting to a Text file, the name of any referenced Named Password Policy
is also exported.  However, there is no facility to also export the values contained in
these <b>Named Password Policies</b>.</p>

<p>Due to the above restriction, when importing a Text file, if the any record
references a Named Password Policy that does not exist in the current database,
then the entry will be changed to use the current database default policy.  Warning messages
will be placed in the Import log show which entries have been affected.</p>

<h2>Merge and Drag &amp; Drop</h2>

<p>When a whole or subset of a database is merged into the current database, any
Named Password Policy referenced by the entries being merged will be brought
across from the source database. If a Named Password Policy of the same name
already exists in the current database and it has the same policy settings as that being
copied across, then it will be used by any entries referencing is are merged.  However,
if the imported Named Password Policy has different policy settings to that in
the database with the same name, then it will be imported with the word
"Merged - <i>datetime</i>" appended to its name (where the '<i>datetime</i>' is the
date/time of the Merge) and all entries referring to it will now reference the newly
named policy.</p>

<p>Similarly, when one or more entries are dragged from another database and dropped into
the current database except "Drag - <i>datetime</i>" will be used to make the
Named Password Policy unique.</p>
