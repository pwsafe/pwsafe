<h2>Compare Results</h2>

<img alt="Compare Results dialog" src="images/compare_results.jpg">

<p>After the two databases are compared, if there are any differences detected, the above
dialog is shown.  <i>Note: only the fields selected by the user are compared, so database
could be shown as being identical when they are not due to the corresponding fields not
being compared.</i>  By default, <u>all</u> fields are compared.  However, if you select a different
set, via the Advanced Settings dialog during Compare, then these fields will only be
compared during this invocation of <b>Password Safe</b> unless you change then again
via the Advance Settings dialog.  The same is true for all the Wizard functions, although
the values are independent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compare</li>
<li>Export to Text (the whole database or a single entry)</li>
<li>Export to XML (the whole database or a single entry)</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Synchronize</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of options available to the user if differences are detected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right click on an entry in the current database (first column):</li>
<ul>
<li>Edit the entry if the database is in R/W mode and the entry is not protected</li>
<li>View the entry if the database is in R-O mode or the entry is protected</li>
</ul>
<li>Right click on an entry in the comparison database (second column):</li>
<ul>
<li>View the entry (the comparison database is always in R-O mode as we are unable to provide
the Undo facitility if it is changed).
<li>Copy the entry to the current database, overwriting its equivalent entry there if the current
database is in R-W mode and the existing entry is not procteted.</li>
<li>Synchonize the entry to its equivalent in the current database, if the current
database is in R-W mode and the existing entry is not procteted.</li>
<li>If the entry is in both databases and have differences, then you can also do "Compare Entries",
which will display all the fields and their contents indicating which are different.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>In addition, multiple entries may be selected in the comparision database (left-click in the
second column with the Ctrl key pressed for the second and subsequent entries).  Once a number are selected,
you can either "Copy All" of them to the current database or "Synchronize All" of them with their
equivalent entries in the current database.  Note: Synchronize will only be allowed if all selected
entries are in also the current database.  A protected entry in the current database cannot be included
in any multiple selection as it cannot be changed.  As in the main Tree view, the title field
has a '&#35;' appended to its value if the entry is protected.</p>
