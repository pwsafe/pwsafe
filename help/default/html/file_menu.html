<h2>File Menu</h2>

<img alt="File Menu" src="images/file_menu.jpg">

<p>The <b>File Menu</b> contains options related to managing and creating new
<b>Password Safe</b> databases.</p>

<h3>New</h3>

<p>Create a new blank password safe database.</p>

<h3>Open</h3>

<p>Open an existing password safe database. When presented with the Open
dialog, you may specify to open an existing database in Read/Write of
Read-Only mode. After opening, the current status will be shown in the
Status Bar at the bottom of the <b>Password Safe</b> window. At any
time after this, the user may double-click on that part of the Status
Bar to switch between these two modes or use a menu item on the "File"
menu.  It may not be possible to switch a database to Read-Write mode
if another user currently has the database open in Read/Write mode.
You may also use the change mode menu item further down this menu to
switch modes instead of double-clicking on the Status Bar.</p>

<h3>Close</h3>

<p>Closes the currently open password safe database without exiting the application.</p>

<h3>Lock</h3>

<p>Depending on whether the user has enable the use of the System Tray, this locks
the currently open password safe database either to the Task Bar (left-click to show
dialog to unlock) or into the System Tray (right-click to show the context menu where
you can restore the database or just unlock it). The Master Passphrase will be
required to reopen/unlock the database. The Lock button can also be placed on the Toolbar
using the Toolbar Customization (right-click on the Toolbar).</p>

<h3>Recent</h3>

<p>This section of the file menu may list the recently
opened database files. This section will be blank if this is the first
time <b>Password Safe</b> has been used.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<small>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The list of recently opened files may be cleared by selecting "<b>Clear Recent Safe List</b>"</li>
<li>The number of recent files that <b>Password Safe</b> will keep may be configured via the
<a href="system_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;System"</a>
tab, where you may also configure if you prefer to see the recent files in the File menu,
or as a submenu.</li>
</ul>
</small>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3>Save</h3>

<p>Save any changes to the current safe. If no changes have been made
since the previous save, or if the database was opened read-only, this
choice will be greyed-out.</p>

<h3>Save As</h3>

<p>Save a copy of the current safe under a new name or location.</p>

<h3>Export To</h3>

<p>Export the contents of the current database to an
external file in either an old <b>Password Safe</b> database format,
XML, or as text. If a filter is active, you can export those satisfying
the filter conditions to a <b>Password Safe</b> database in the current format.
In this case, if an alias or shortcut is included in the filter results, its base
entry will also be exported even if it does not satisfy those conditons.
See <a href="export.html">here</a> for more information on exporting the database
to other formats.</p>

<h3>Import From</h3>

<p>Import the contents of a previously <a href="export.html">exported</a> or
correctly formatted text file, XML, or a KeePass V1 password
database into the current database. See <a href="import.html">here</a> for
more information on importing text files.</p>

<h3>Merge</h3>

<p>Merge a <b>Password Safe</b> database or backup file (.bak) into the current database.
Disabled in read-only mode.  Merge uses a Wizard interface. You may also select the Advanced
field selection in order to restrict which entries you merge into your current database.</p>

<h3>Compare</h3>

<p>Compare the currently opened database with another. Compare uses a Wizard interface.
You may also select the Advanced field selection in order to restrict which entries and
which fields of these entries you compare between the two databases.
See <a href="compare_results.html">here</a> for more information when the results
are displayed.</p>

<h3>Synchronize</h3>

<p>Synchronize the currently opened database with another.</p>
<p>The main difference between Merge and Synchronize is that during a Merge,
all elements of the merging database will be taken to the currently
opened database. During synchronizing however, only elements
in the currently opened database will be updated. Synchronize uses a Wizard interface.
You may also select the Advanced field selection in order to restrict which entries and
which fields of these entries you synchronize between the two databases.</p>

<h3>Change to R-O / Change to R/W</h3>
<p>A database that's open for reading and writing (the default) can be protected against unintended changes by selecting the <b>Change to R-O</b>
entry. Likewise, a read-only database can be modified after clicking on <b>Change to R/W</b>. When changing to read-write, you
will be prompted for the master password. You can also switch between these modes by double-clicking on the R/W / R-O text in the status bar on the bottom of the application's window.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The Merge, Compare and Synchronize operations may take a long time, especially for large databases.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>Display information about the currently opened password safe database, such as: format
version, number of groups, number of entries, and information about
when it was last saved and by whom.</p>

<img alt="Database Properties" src="images/db_properties.jpg">

<h3>Exit</h3>

<p>Closes the <b>Password Safe</b> program. If changes were made to the database since the last
save, you will be prompted to save the database.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Reports</h4>

<p><b>Note:</b> Compare, Export, Import, Merge and Synchronize all produce a report
that can be viewed in a dialog and then copied to the clipboard or saved to disk
as a text file in the same directory as the database. The 
<a href="view_menu.html">"View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Reports"</a>menu item may then be
used to view the reports at a later date. The name of the report file is fixed and
dependent on the function that created it. If the same function is repeated
and its report saved to disk, any existing report for this function will be
overwritten. <span style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The report may contain sensitive data and
care should be taken when selecting the "save to disk" option.</span></p>
