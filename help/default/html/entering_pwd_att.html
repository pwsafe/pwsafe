<h2>User Names, Passwords, and Groups: Password Policy</h2>

<p>Username, passwords and groups together with the additional parameters are managed in 5 tabs:</p>

<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_add.html">Additional</a></i>:</b> additional specifications, including history</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_date.html">Dates and Times</a></i>:</b> expiry and statistics</li>

<p>Password Safe allows you to add an attachment, such as an image (jpeg file) or document (text, pdf, etc.) to an entry.
    If the attachment is an image, you will see a preview of it in this tab. You can export the attachment as a file,
    which will be identical to the file you've imported, or you can remove the attachment.
</p>

<h4>To Import an Attachment</h4>
<p>In the Attachment tab, click on the "Import..." button, and select the file you wish to attach. Note that by default you can only select image files (.jpeg, .png, etc.).
    If you wish to select a file of another type, click on the file filter to the right of the File name field and select "All files (*.*)".<br>
    Note that if the entry already has an attachment, the "Import..." button will be disabled, since an entry can only have up to one attachment. If you wish to replace the attachment, first click on "Remove".
</p>
<p>Optionally, you can give the attachment a descriptive name. Note that this has no relation to the filename, which is what the file was named when you imported it.</p>

<h4>To Export an Attachment</h4>
<p>To export an attachment, click on the "Export..." button and select the location and name of the file.</p>

<h4>To Remove an Attachment</h4>
<p>To remove an attachment, just click on the "Remove" button. Note that if you didn't intend to remove the attachment, just click on "Cancel" and the "Discard" and the removal will not take effect.
    If you've already clicked on "OK", ou can still undo the removal by selecting Undo under the Edit menu (or typing Ctrl-Z).
