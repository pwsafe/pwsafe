<h2>Backing Up and Restoring Databases</h2>

<p>Since the information stored in a password database is usually both
sensitive and important, <b>Password Safe</b>
provides several mechanisms for backing up and restoring password
databases. This section describes how to manually make backups of your
password database <b>Password Safe</b>
can also be configured to make <i>automatic</i>
backups of your database whenever the database is saved. Such backups are called
<i>intermediate backups</i>, and are described
<a href="backups_tab.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Make a Backup</h3>

<p>Safely create a copy of the current password database.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Make Backup</b></li>
<li>Select a location for the backup file</li>
<li>Click <b>Save</b></li>
</ol>

<hr>
<small>
<p><b>Note:</b> It is <b><u>strongly recommended</u></b>
that you make frequent backups of your password databases. This will
help safeguard password lists against system crashes or corrupted
files. The backup is encrypted using the same master password as the
current database being backed up.  In particular, via the
<i><a href="backups_tab.html">Backups</a></i> tab in
the Options dialog box, you may specify how many backups to keep
(<i>we recommend a minimum of 3 to 5</i>) and whether to use an incremental
number or date/time value in the backup file name.</p>
</small>

<hr>

<h3>Restore from Backup</h3>

<p>Restore a backed up password database file.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>Restore from Backup</b></li>
<li>Navigate to the backup location and select the file to restore</li>
<li>Click <b>Open</b> and a password prompt will be displayed.</li>
<li>Enter the database password and click <b>OK</b></li>
</ol>

<hr>
<small>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>The restored database is not "saved" with the standard <b>Password Safe</b>
database extension (.psafe3) until you have selected <b>Save</b> or <b>Save As</b>
from the file menu. You will be prompted to "Save" the database and
give it a name if you have not saved it prior to exiting the
application.</li>
<li>In addition to the backup and restore described here, <b>Password Safe</b>
automatically keeps a copy of the database before you save a change. The copy
is in the same directory as the current database, and the name is identical,
except for the extension, which is ".ibak", meaning "incremental backup",
instead of ".psafe3". See <a href="backups_tab.html">here</a> for more
information about the automatic backups.</li>
</ul>
