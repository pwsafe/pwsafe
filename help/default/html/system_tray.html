<p>The <b>System Tray</b> context menu gives quick access to recently used entries (if the
  database is unlocked) and to unlock the database if locked. You can
  also use it to minimize the main <b>PasswordSafe</b> window and
  restore it if already minimized but not locked.</p>

<h3>Set Database ID</h3>

<p>If you regularly keep several databases open, you may
set a unique temporary ID (a number between 1 and 99) that will be superimposed on top of
the System Tray icon. Setting an ID of zero will remove the number from the image.</p>

<p>An ID is reserved once assigned to an open database but will be free to be used again
either when a new ID is assigned or the database is closed. In addition, the System Tray
tooltip shows the ID before the database name.

<br>
<br>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>The ID is only a visual indicator. <b>PasswordSafe</b> doesn't
  store or use this in any way.</li>
<li>An ID can only be assigned to an opened database. When the database is closed, the ID
is free to be assigned to another open database.</li>
<li>The same ID can't be assigned to two open databases at the same time.</li>
<li>The ID can only be changed when the database is unlocked.</li>
<li>The association of an ID to a particular database is not
  persistent (remembered), that is, you need to reassign it each time
  the database is opened (if needed, of course).</li>
<li>Since the color of the Windows Taskbar and Notification Area
  varies across versions of Windows, you can set the color of the text
  for the best contrast on your system.</li>
<li>If the database is locked, the database name will be shown in the tooltip between
square brackets as shown below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open Another</h3>
This allows you to select another database to be opened instead of the one currently open (or locked) in the current instance of the program.
This is handy if you want to switch between databases without starting another instance of the program.
