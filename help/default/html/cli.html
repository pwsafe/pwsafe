<h2>Command Line Arguments</h2>

<p>Invoking <b>Password Safe</b> with no arguments will cause the application to prompt you for the
combination of the last database that was opened, or for the
combination of a new database if none was previously opened on
your machine (e.g., the first time you use <b>Password Safe</b>).
It is, however, possible to modify this by invoking <b>Password Safe</b> as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>database</b><br>
This will open the specified database file, instead of the last one
opened. If just a filename is
given, without a path, it will be searched for in the directory in which the
application was invoked. Note that if the filename and/or path has
spaces, it should be enclosed in double quotes.</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-r [database]</b><br>
This will open the specified database in read-only mode. If a database is not
specified, then the application will prompt the user for a
database, which will be opened in read-only mode.</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-e filename</b><br>
This will prompt the user for a passphrase, and encrypt the file with a
key derived from the passphrase. <b>Note:</b> The file can
be <i>any</i> file. The encrypted file will have the same
name as the original file, with ".PSF" appended to it.<br></li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-d filename</b><br>
This will prompt the user for a passphrase, and decrypt the file with a
key derived from the passphrase. <b>Note:</b> This will
work only on files that were encrypted by invoking pwsafe with the '-e'
option (see above).</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-c</b><br>
This will start the application closed, that is, with no
database, and without the initial opening dialog (To access a database,
use the File menu).</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-s [database]</b><br>
This will start the application "silently", that is,
minimized and with no database (unless one is specified). When the application
is restored, the user is presented with the opening dialog box (This option
is meant for starting the application upon login, via a shortcut in the user's
Startup folder). <b>Note:</b> This implicitly puts the application in the system tray.</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-m</b><br>
This is the same as the '<b>-c</b>' option, with the addition that the application
is started as minimized.</li>

<li><i>pwsafe</i> <b>-l [country code]</b><br>
This sets the language for any error messages encountered during the processing
of these <i>Command Line Arguments</i> <b>only</b>.  <i>It will not override the
user's language specification once <b>Password Safe</b> is open</i> (see the section
<a href="manage_menu.html#ChangeLanguage">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Change Language"</a>).
Also see the <a href="preferences.html#LanguageFile">"LanguageFile"</a>
preference for the definition of the country code.  Note: if this Command Line Argument
is not used or there is an error processing this particular argument, e.g. the language
file can not be found, the resulting messages will be in English.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following options are accepted and may be useful if you wish to
share the same preferences across several machines, for example,
when running <b>Password Safe</b> from a disk-on-key.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>-u</b> <i>username</i><br>
This will cause the application to read and write preferences under the specified
<i>username</i>, instead of under the login name.</li>

<li><b>-h</b> <i>hostname</i><br>
This will cause the application to read and write preferences under the specified
<i>hostname</i>, instead of under the machine's name.</li>

<li><b>-g</b> <i>config_file</i><br>
This will cause the specified file to be used for loading and storing
preferences, instead of the default pwsafe.cfg. If just a filename is
given, without a path, it will be searched for in the directory in which the
application was invoked unless overridden by setting the <b>PWS_PREFSDIR</b>
environmental variable (see the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> Section).
Note that if the filename and/or path has spaces, it should be enclosed in double quotes.
If the file can not be found, <b>Password Safe</b> will ask if you wish it to be created.
If not or if it can't be created, it will terminate to enable the correct configuration
file to be specified.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Finally, there are some special command line flags beginning with "--".  They are:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>--do-tall, --do-wide, --do-auto</b><br>
By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will check the screen dimensions and choose tall or wide versions of the larger dialog screens. Specifying <b>--do-tall</b> or <b>--do-wide</b> forces the choice, and <b>--do-auto</b> resets the system to use its internal logic. Note that this sets a <a href="preferences.html">preference</a>, so it's enough to use this flag once on a given machine.</li>
<li><b>--novalidate</b><br>
This will prevent <b>Password Safe</b> validating databases automatically when they are
opened.  Some validation is always required e.g. uniqueness of the entry's ID and the
group/title/username combination.</li>

<li><b>--testdump</b><br>
This allows testers to verify the mini-dump production when <b>Password Safe</b> has
a problem to help developers resolve the issue.</li>

<li><b>--cetreeview</b><br>
A new feature allows two entries to be selected and compared either via the Edit menu or
by right-clicking on either.  Selecting more than one entry is natively supported
in the List view but not in the Tree view.  This flag enables "Compare Entries"
in the Tree view via an extra dialog to select the "other" entry.  Supporting
multiple selection in the Tree view is under development.  Once supported,
this flag will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
