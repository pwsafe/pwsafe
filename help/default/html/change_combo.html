<h2>Changing Master Passwords</h2>

<p>To change a master password ("Safe Combination"), first open up
the database whose password you wish to change. Once opened, go to the <b>Manage</b>
menu and select <b>Change Safe Combination</b>. The following window will be displayed:</p>

<img alt="Key Change dialog box" src="images/combo_change.jpg">

<p><b>Note:</b> If you do not have a <a href="about_pws_yubi.html">YubiKey</a>,
then the YubiKey buttons will not be displayed,
and you can ignore the description of their use below.</p>

<p>To change a master password ("Safe Combination"), first open up the database whose
password you wish to change. Once opened, go to the <b>Manage</b> menu and
select <b>Change Safe Combination</b>. You should enter the current master
password, and then the new master password (twice, for confirmation). The master
password can be entered using the physical or virtual keyboard.</p>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> has a built in check for what it considers to be weak
master passwords. In general, a master password (like any password) should consist
of mixed case characters with at least one number or
<a href="javascript:popup.TextPopup(strSpecialChars,popFont,9,9,-1,-1)">special character</a>
(such as those found above the number keys on a keyboard). If a master password
is entered that the program considers weak, it will prompt for confirmation.
You may the option to accept the originally entered (weak) password, or to enter
a new one.</p>

<p>On checking the "Show Combination" box, the contents of old and new combination
will be visible in clear and the confirmation combination edit box is disabled as
no longer necessary.</p>

<p>For <strong>YubiKey</strong> users: In addition to changing the master
password as described above, this window allows you to add or remove YubiKey
authentication, add or remove additional password authentication, as well as
switch the YubiKey that is used to access the current database. Following are
instructions for each of these actions:</p>

<h3>Adding YubiKey Authentication</h3>

<p>To convert a Password Safe database that is accessed using a Master
Password (Safe Combination) to YubiKey access:<br>
<ol>
<li>Enter the current Master Password in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
<li>Insert you YubiKey</li>
<li>If you wish, enter (and confirm) a password in the New Safe
Combination and Confirmation fields.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey.<li>
</ol>

<h3>Removing YubiKey Authentication</h3>

<p>To change the PasswordSafe database so that it is only protected by
a master password:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert your YubiKey</li>
<li>If you currently have a password associated with this
database, enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey</li>
<li>Set the New Safe Combination (and the Confirmation) to the
desired value.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding/Removing/Changing Password Authentication</h3>

<p>Password Safe can use YubiKey as the only access mechanism, or along
with a conventional password. To change from one to another:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert your YubiKey</li>
<li>If you currently have a password associated with this
database, enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey</li>
<li>Set the New Safe Combination (and the Confirmation) to the
desired value: Blank to remove the password, or a new password
to add or replace the password.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing YubiKeys</h3>

<p>To switch from one YubiKey to another:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert the old YubiKey</li>
<li>If you have a password associated with this database as well,
enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey</li>
<li>Remove the old YubiKey, insert the new one</li>
<li>If you wish, enter (and confirm) a password in the New Safe
Combination and Confirmation fields.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
activate your YubiKey.<br>
</li>
</ol>

<p><small><b>Notes:</b></small></p>
<ul>
<li><small><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There is no mechanism within
Password Safe to retrieve lost or forgotten safe passwords</span></b>.
This is a deliberate design decision, since any mechanism for retrieving
lost passwords poses a security hole that can be exploited.</small></li>
<li><small>Please choose a difficult-to-guess password. A trivial
password, such as "password" or your name is easy to guess,
and negates
the security that <b>Password Safe</b> provides.<br>
</small></li>
