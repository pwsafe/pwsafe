<p>Through the <b>Edit Menu</b> you can add, edit, use and organize
user names and passwords. Note that the contents of this menu change
according to what's selected in the main view (e.g., if you've selected
an entry or a group). Also, some items may be disabled, as noted below.</p>

<h3>Add Entry</h3>

<p>Add a new user name and password. This is disabled if the
database is opened read-only.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="entering_pwd.html">User
Names, Passwords, and Groups</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Edit Entry / Expand/Collapse Group</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, Edit the selected user name and password.
When a Group is selected (in Tree view), this will expand or collapse
the display of entries under the selected group. Editing an entry is
disabled if the database is opened read-only.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="entering_pwd.html">User
Names, Passwords, and Groups</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Delete Entry / Delete Group</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, this will delete it. When a Group is
selected (in Tree view), this will delete all entries under the
selected group. Confirmation is requested if there is more than one
entry in the selected group. This is disabled if the database
is opened read-only.</p>

<h3>Rename Entry / Rename Group</h3>

<p>Rename the selected entry (or group, in Tree
view). This is disabled if the database is opened read-only. </p>

<h3>Find Entry</h3>

<p>Find an entry containing a given text. By default, all fields
except the Password field are searched.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="searching.html">Searching</a> for more
information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Duplicate Entry</h3>

<p>Duplicates the selected entry. This is disabled if
the database is opened read-only.</p>

<h3>Add Group</h3>

<p>Create a new password group (e.g., Banking
Passwords). This is disabled if the database is opened
read-only.</p>

<h3>Undo</h3>

<p>The last action will be reversed. Repeating Undo will undo the actions
in reverse order, from last to earliest.</p>

<h3>Redo</h3>
<p>The last undone action(s) will be executed again.</p>

<h3>Clear Clipboard</h3>

<p>Clear the clipboard's memory. This clears the clipboard of
anything that was pasted there by <b>Password Safe</b> (password, username, notes, etc.).
If the current contents of the clipboard did not come from <b>Password Safe</b>, then
this will have no effect.</p>

<h3>Copy Password to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's password to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Display subset of Password</h3>

<p>This action displays a window that allows you to specify which
characters of a password to display. This is useful for sites that ask
for parts of a password to login. For example, a password might be
"qAdm3ddENc", and you might be asked to enter the first, third, fifth
and eighth letters. This window allows you to do this in a convenient
manner: In the upper field you enter the positions of the
password characters you want for the subset of the password. You can
use spaces, commas or semi-colons to separate the positions. The
corresponding characters of the password are shown in the lower field.
To quit, please use the <b>Esc</b> key.</p>

<h3>Copy User Name to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy current selection's user name to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy Notes to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the contents of current selection's notes field to the
clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy URL to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's URL field to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy email to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's email field to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy Run Command to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's Run Command field to the clipboard.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Variables will be substituted by their values default <u>unless</u> the Ctrl key
is pressed down when selecting this menu item.</li>

<h3>Browse to URL</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, and the entry has a URL associated
with it, then this will invoke the default browser to the URL. If no entry
is selected, or the selected entry's URL is blank, this command will be
disabled.</p>

<p><small><b>Unless changed via the
<a href="misc_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Security"</a>
tab, the entry's password will automatically be copied into the Clipboard.</b></small></p>

<h3>Browse to URL + AutoType</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, and the entry has a URL associated
with it, then this will invoke the default browser to the URL. If no entry
is selected, or the selected entry's URL is blank, this command will be
disabled.</p>

<p>Automatically input user name and password into the selected
input field.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="autotype.html">Using AutoType</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Send email</h3>

<p>Prepare an email to be sent with the data in the current selection's email field.
Please ensure that you have an email client installed on your computer.<br>
<small><i>See <a href="entering_pwd.html">User Names, Passwords, and Groups</a>
for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Perform AutoType</h3>

<small><i>See <a href="autotype.html">Using AutoType</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Run Command</h3>

<p>This will execute the command in the field <i>Run Cmd</i> of the selected entry.<br>
<small><i>See <a href="run_command.html">Using Run Command</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Create Shortcut</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, this allows you to create a
reference to the entry, typically in another group. This is useful if
you have an entry that "belongs" under more than one group, but you
don't wish to duplicate data. A shortcut has a distinct icon associated
with it, <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="shortcut" src="images/shortcut.png">,
and by default has the name "shortcut to <i>x</i>", where <i>x</i> is
the title of the original entry. Of course, you can edit the name, move
or delete the shortcut, just like a regular entry.</p>

<h3>Go to Base entry</h3>

<p>This item will only appear for a shortcut or alias entry.
After clicking <b>Go to Base entry</b> the corresponding
base entry will be selected.</p>

<h3>Edit Base entry</h3>

<p>This item will only appear for a shortcut or alias entry.
After clicking <b>Edit Base entry</b> you can edit the corresponding
base entry to this shortcut or alias.</p>

<h3>Export Entry or Group</h3>

<img alt="Menu Edit Entry" src="images/edit_export.jpg">
<ul>
<li>Plain Text</li>

<p>The selected entry or all entries within the selected group will be exported
as plain text. Before exporting, you will be asked to input the Master Passphrase
as confirmation that you intend to export data from the database into an unencrypted
text file.<br>

<li>XML format</li>

<p>The selected entry or all entries within the selected group will be exported
in XML format. Before exporting, you will be asked to input the Master Passphrase
as confirmation that you intend to export data from the database into an unencrypted
XML file.</p>

<li><b>Password Safe</b> Format</li>

<p>The selected entry or all entries within the selected group will be exported 
as a new <b>Password Safe</b> database. Before exporting, you will be asked to input the Master
Passphrase as confirmation that you intend to export data from the database into another
<b>Password Safe</b> database. You will also be required to provide a new passphrase for the
new <b>Password Safe</b> database.</p>
</ul>

<p><small><i>See also <a href="export.html">Exporting Entries</a> for more information.</i></small>
</p>

<h3>Protect entry / Protect All Entries</h3>

<p>The selected entry or group of entries will be protected. A
protected entry cannot be modified until it is unprotected. Protected entries
are marked with a '#'.</p>

<h2>Right mouse click actions </h2>

<p>All functions in the <b>Edit</b> menu can also be reached by clicking the right mouse
button on the corresponding entry, alias or group.</p>

<p>In addtion, when right clicking on an alias or shortcut base entry, there is an extra
submenu ("Go to Aliases..." and "Go to Shortcuts...") to allow easy access to their respective
dependants, i.e. aliases or shortcuts. Although, all dependants will be on the new submenu,
some may be disabled if, for example, a filter is active and the entry is not visible or if
there are more than the maximum of 25 dependants that can be referenced by this function.</p>
