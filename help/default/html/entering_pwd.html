<h2>User Names, Passwords, and Groups: Basic</h2>

<p>Username, passwords and groups together with the additional parameters are managed in 4 tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Basic</i>:</b> all necessary elements for password management</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_add.html">Additional</a></i>:</b> additional specifications, including history</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_date.html">Dates and Times</a></i>:</b> expiry and statistics</li>
<li><b><i><a href="entering_pwd_pp.html">Password Policy</a></i>:</b> specific differences to the default</li>
</ul>

<p>Most labels in the Basic and Additional Property Pages are <i>Smart Labels</i>.
This means that when you click on them, the current contents of the relevant field
are copied to the clipboard. The label will flash green to show that the data has
been copied.  The currently supported labels are:
<ul>
<li><b>Basic</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Group</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Notes</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Additional</b></li>
<ul>
<li>AutoType</li>
<li>Run Command</li>
<br><br><b>Note:</b> By pressing the Ctrl key down whilst clicking on the AutoType and Run Command
labels, variables will not be substituted in the strings before copying to the clipboard.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><i>Basic</i> Tab</h3>

<p>In this tab the most important elements are combined.</p>
<img alt="Edit/View Entry" src="images/edit_view_entry_base.jpg">
<p>The following bits of information are associated with each
password entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Group</b>: A name for grouping (organizing) several related entries</li>
<li><b>Title</b>: A friendly name for a password entry</li>
<li><b>User name</b>: The user name</li>
<li><b>Password</b>: The password</li>
<li><b>Notes</b>: Free-form general notes field</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Only the <b>Title</b> and <b>Password</b> fields are required; all others are optional.</i></p>
  
<p>The <b>Notes</b> field is intended for a <i>short/brief amount of text and has a character
limit of 30,000</i>. Whilst it is possible to add more than this limit when the entry is added,
warnings will be issued when the database is re-opened. The Notes field will be truncated
to this limit if the entry is edited. However, if the entry is protected or the database is opened
in read-only mode, then it can be viewed without any truncation.</p>

<a name="notes_external_editor"></a>
<p>The <b>Notes</b> field contents may be edited using an external editor by
right-clicking on the field. Note however, that <i>the contents will saved
temporarily on disk in clear text</i>. In addition, some external editors will
use an existing instance to edit the temporary text file and this will cause
<b>Password Safe</b> to immediately return leaving the data unchanged even though
the temporary text file is still available in the external editor. If the external
editor supports it, it is possible to specify command line parameters to force a
new instance for editing the Notes field to prevent this (for example: "-multiInst"
for the Notepad++ editor).
See <a href="misc_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Misc."</a>.
If you do specify command line paramters, do <b>not</b> enclose them in quotes unless your
chosen external editor requires them.  The value you specify will be used <i>as-is</i>
with no changes.</p>

<p>In addition, the following fields may be set in this tab:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>URL</b>: The URL associated with the entry. If this field is not empty, then the "Go" button
is enabled. If the protocol is not specified, then "http://" is assumed
(e.g., "www.foo.net" is the same as "http://www.foo.net"). The <b>Go</b> button to the right
of the <b>URL</b> field is enabled if the URL field is not empty. Clicking with the Control key
pressed (Ctrl+Click) will, in addition, invoke the <a href="autotype.html">AutoType</a>
function on the opened browser page. See the <a href="#URL_details">following notes</a>
for more information.</li>
<li><b>email</b>: The email address associated with this entry. Note
that this is meant for keeping an e-mail address associated with the
site, e.g., support@myvendor.com. If the site requires an e-mail
address as your login, it's much easier to set your email address in
the Username field. <br/>
If this field is not empty, then the "Send" button is enabled. Clicking on this button will
invoke the default mail program with the To: field set to the specified address.
See the <a href="#email_details">following notes</a>
for more options.</li>
</ul>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<small>

<b><a name="URL_details"></a> The following notes describe the way
URLs are handled in more detail:</b>
<ul>
<li>By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will use the browser that your
PC usually opens web pages with. If desired, you can specify an
<i>alternate browser</i> by
putting '[alt]' before the URL, e.g., "[alt]http://www.foo.net". This
is useful, for example, if your default browser is Firefox, and you
wish to access a website that works best with Internet Explorer. To
configure an alternate browser, use the
<a href="misc_tab.html#AltBrowser">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Misc."</a> dialog box.
</li>

<li>If '{alt}' is put before the URL, then it is passed
'as-is' to the alternate browser, that is, without adding 'http://' if
no protocol is specified. This is useful if the alternate browser is a
remote access application, e.g., an SSH client. [ssh] will achieve the
same effect.</li>

<li>If '[autotype]' is found before the URL, then after the
URL has been displayed/actioned, <b>Password Safe</b> then performs the AutoType
action using this entry's AutoType field, or the default value if not
specified.</li>

</ul>
<a name="email_details"></a>
<b>The email address is according to the standard rules (per RFC 2368):</b>
<ul>
<li>The address can be one or more valid email addresses separated by a
semicolon, using 'Internet-safe characters. Use %20 for the space
character.</li>
<li>The address can be followed by one or more name-value pairs. The first
pair should be prefixed by a "?" and any additional pairs should be prefixed
by an ampersand (&amp;). The name can be one of the following strings:</li>

<ul>
<li>subject - followed by text to appear in the subject line of the message.</li>
<li>body - followed by text to appear in the body of the message.</li>
<li>CC - followed by addresses to be included in the "cc" (carbon copy) section of the message.</li>
<li>BCC - followed by addresses to be included in the "bcc" (blind carbon copy) section of the message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: user@example.com?subject=Message Title&amp;body=Message Content"</p>
</ul>

<h3><a>Creating a New User Name and Password Entry</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>Open the database where you wish to place the new entry</li>
<li>From the <b>Edit</b> menu, select <b>Add Entry</b></li>
<li>Enter information into the <b>Edit/View Entry</b> dialog fields as necessary</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> If a Group name is selected and then a new entry added,
that entry will have that Group name prefilled in the <b>Edit/View Entry</b> dialog.
If a name of a new group is added to the Group field, that Group will
be created.</small><br>
<hr>

<h3><a>Generating and Editing Passwords</a></h3>

<p>If you wish, you can enter your own password into the password
field manually, or you can have <b>Password Safe</b> generate a new one
based on the current <a href="password_policies.html">Password Policy</a>.
To have <b>Password Safe </b>generate a password, just click on <b>Generate</b>
in the <b>Edit/View Entry</b> dialog. If you're unhappy with the result,
you can click on <b>Generate</b> again, or edit the password manually.</p>

<hr>

<small><b>Note:</b> If you're using a "single sign-on" system that allows
you to share the same password across different machines/servers/applications,
etc. you can setup <b>Password Safe</b> entries accordingly, so that changing
one password affects all other related entries. This is called "aliasing"
entries, and is explained in detail <a href="aliases.html">here</a>.
</small>

<hr>
<h3>Editing Existing Entries</h3>

<ol>
<li>Select the entry to edit from the list</li>
<li>Select <b>Edit/View Entry</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>Editing Existing Entries via the Tree View</h3>

<ol>
<li>Select the entry to edit from the list then:</li>
<li>Select <b>Edit/View Entry</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu <b>OR</b></li>
<li>Right-click on the entry and select <b>Edit/View Entry</b>
from the context menu</li>
<li>You can change the fields that are displayed in the tree view
  directly. To do so:
<ul>
<li>Right-click on a group and select <b>Rename Group</b> from the
context menu <b>OR</b></li>
<li>Press the shortcut key to rename (default F2) and overtype the
displayed text (format is "title [username] {password}").</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<hr>
<small>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>By default, usernames and passwords are not displayed in the Tree View. Displaying
the username and the password are controlled by preferences (see:
<a href="display_tab.html">Display Tab</a>). They work in a hierachy i.e. passwords can
only be displayed if usernames are displayed.</li>
<li>Also by default, passwords are obscured when editing the entry. To see
the password associated with the entry click <b>Show Password</b> when editing it.
<li>The title and password are the only mandatory fields for an entry. Therefore, if
they are ommited during rename, they will retain their previous values.
However, you may clear the username field, as long as it is being displayed,
by entering "[]" during the rename implying an empty value.</li>
<li><i>Since square and curly brackets are used to delimit the username and password,
it is <b>NOT</b> possible to rename an entry in place (e.g. using F2) if the title, username
(if displayed) or password (if displayed) contain any of these characters.  Instead, you must
Edit the entry either via the Edit menu or by the right-click context menu as indicated
above.</i></li>
</ol>
</small>
<hr>

<h3>Add a New Group via Tree View</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select <b>Add Group</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu</li>
<li>Enter the Group name</li>
</ol>

<h3>Edit a Group Name</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the group and select <b>Rename Group</b>
from the context menu or</li>
<li>Select the group and press the shortcut to rename (default F2) and overtype the
group name.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<small>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Group names can be "nested" i.e. placing a group name within/under another group name.</li>
<li>A group cannot be renamed to multiple groups through the <b>Rename Group</b> menu item or
shortcut, i.e., group "a" cannot be renamed to "x.y".</li>
</ol>
</small>

<h3>Protected Entries</h3>

<p>If the entry is protected, you will not be able to change any fields until you unprotect
the entry via the Edit menu or right-click context menu. Protected entries will be indicated
in red at the bottom of this tab.</p>
