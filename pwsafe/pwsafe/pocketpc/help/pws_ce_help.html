    <a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b>
    <P>How many passwords and user names do you have to keep track of?  Chances are that the answer is "lots."  It was bad enough when you only needed a password to access your network or shell account; now many websites want passwords too.  Most people resort to keeping a written list of passwords (unsafe) or using the same password on many systems (very unsafe).  Now, with Password Safe, you can keep a master list of passwords securely encrypted on your computer. A single Safe Combination unlocks them all.</P>
    <P>Password Safe protects your passwords with Bruce Schneier's Blowfish algorithm, a fast, free alternative to DES and IDEA.  Details on the Blowfish algorithm, including speed comparisons and an extensive list of products that use Blowfish, are available at <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html">http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html</a></P>
    <P></P>
    <P>Password Safe allows you to have any number of different password databases.  For example, you can store your website passwords in one, your Unix account passwords in another, etc.  Don't forget to backup your various databases often. If you wish to have only one database, no problem.  Password Safe will take care of all the detail for you and you don't need to bother with any of the file handling commands.</P>

    <p><b>Getting Started</b></p>
    <P>You can start protecting your passwords with Password Safe in three easy steps.</P>

	<ol>
      <li><i>Creating a Safe Combination</i>
      <P>When you first start up Password Safe, it will ask you to create a combination. The combination is just like a password; it can include letters and punctuation as well as numbers.  Your safe combination keeps all your other passwords safe, so don't use something that's easy to guess -- especially if someone else could get access to your computer. Safe combinations are case sensitive; &quote;hello&quote; is different from &quote;HELLO&quote;.</P>
      <P>When you've chosen your combination, type it in the box marked "Safe Combination," then again in the box marked "verify."  Then click OK.  The OK button will only be activated if you typed the same Safe Combination both times.</P>
      <P>Whenever you start up Password Safe, it will reopen (with the proper password, of course) the last open password database.  If this database cannot be found, you will be able to browse for another one or create a new blank database.</P>

      <li><i>Entering Passwords</i>
      <P>After you've created your combination, you can start entering passwords.  Just select the menu item titled <A HREF="pws_ce_help.html#adddata">Add Entry</A> or click the toolbar button. Enter the name of the service this password is for, your username on that service (if any), and then the password itself. You can also set a default username in the <A HREF="pws_ce_help.html#options">Options</A> dialog box.</P>
      <P>You can use the "Notes" field to enter any other information you need to remember about the service -- phone numbers, URLs, etc.</P>

      <li><i>Retrieving Passwords</i>
      <P>To copy a password to the Windows clipboard, just double-click on the desired title. Or you can highlight the tile and select the Copy Password to Clipboard menu item. You can then paste the password into whichever Windows application requires it.  (If the application does not provide a Copy command on its menu, you can still paste by hitting Control-V or Shift-Insert.)</P>
      <P>The clipboard will be cleared when you close Password Safe.</P>
    </ol>

    <a name="main"></a><b>Password Safe Main Window</b>

    <p>
    Password Safes main window shows the entries in a list.  The first time this list is shown there will be columns for the title, username and notes although the password can also be shown if desired by setting an option.
    <p>
    The menu bar options are described in the following sections:
    <menu>

You can use the "Notes" field for any other information you need to remember about this item -- such as a URL or phone number.</P>
    <P>You can leave the username and notes fields blank, but you must enter data in the title and password fields.</P>
    <P>Note that the entry for this item in the list in the main dialog with be the service name and user name separated by a dash.</P>

<!-- PegHelp -->

    <a name="editview"></a><b>Edit/View Data</b>
    <P>In this window, you can change the information you've stored for an entry.  By default, the password will be replaced with a line of asterisks.  To view your existing password, hit "Show Password."</P>
    <P>If you make a mistake and want to leave this window without saving your changes, hit "Cancel."  To save changes, click the "OK" button.</P>

<!-- PegHelp -->

    <a name="copyclip"></a><b>Copy Password to Clipboard</b>
    <P>This dialog lets you know that the password you've selected has been copied to the clipboard. You can now paste it directly into the application, dialog, or Web form that needs a password.</P>
    <P>If you're pasting the password into a dialog, you probably won't have a Paste command available, but you can still paste using the keyboard shortcuts control-V or shift-insert.</P>

<!-- PegHelp -->

    <a name="changecombo"></a><b>Safe Combination Change</b>
    <P>Use this window to change your Safe Combination for the current database. You will need to enter the old Safe Combination, then enter the new combination twice. The combinations will be masked by asterisks. The combinations are case sensitive; the safe combination &quote;hello&quote; is different from &quote;HELLO&quote;.</P>

<!-- PegHelp -->

    <a name="comboentry"></a><b>Safe Combination Entry</b>
    <P>This window appears when you start up Password Safe and whenever you open a different database or restore a backup.  Enter your safe combination and click OK. Safe combinations are case sensitive; &quot;hello&quot; is different from &quot;HELLO&quot;.</P>
    <P>If you enter the safe combination incorrectly three times, the <a href="pws_ce_help.html#comboerror">Safe Combination Entry Error</a> window will appear. This window lets you try to open another database or start a new one.</P>

<!-- PegHelp -->

    <a name="comboerror"></a><b>Safe Combination Entry Error</b>
    <P>This window appears if the Safe Combination has been entered incorrectly three times.  If you just mistyped your safe combination, you can choose to try again. You can also choose to browse for another database to open or to create another, completely new, database.</P>
    <P>If you've forgotten your safe combination, just leave that database for now.  You'll be able to reopen this database later if you remember your combination.  Unfortunately, nothing can be done if you forget your password entirely.  The security of this system rests on the fact that the database cannot be recovered without the password.</P>

    <A NAME="counterpane"></A><b>About Counterpane</b>
    <P><a href="http://www.counterpane.com">http://www.counterpane.com</a></P>
    <P><B>Company Information</B></P>
    <P><I>Counterpane Systems</I> is a cryptography and computer security consulting firm. We are a virtual company based in Minneapolis, with three full-time employees and six part-time contractors. Counterpane provides expert consulting in the following areas:</P>
    <P>Design and Analysis. This is the majority of Counterpane's work: making and breaking commercial cryptographic systems and system designs. We can analyze all aspects of a security system, from the threat model to the cryptographic algorithms, and from the protocols to the implementation and procedures. Our detailed reports provide clients with information on security problems as well as suggested fixes.</P>
    <P>Counterpane Systems has worked in areas such as:</P>
    <sl>
    <li>Hard disk and file encryption</P>
    <li>E-mail encryption and authentication</P>
    <li>Emergency password and data recovery</P>
    <li>Software and information piracy prevention</P>
    <li>Virtual private networks</P>
    <li>Certificate Authority systems</P>
    <li>Digital timestamping</P>
    <li>Digital telecommunications security</P>
    <li>Biometric security applications</P>
    <li>Java security</P>
    <li>Electronic commerce systems</P>
    <li>Stored-value card security</P>
    <li>Secure audit logs</P>
    </sl>
    <P><B>Implementation and Testing</B>. Counterpane Systems also turns designs into commercial programs. We have implemented and tested many cryptographic systems, both from our own designs and from industry standards such as SET, S/MIME, and SSL. Counterpane also performs security testing and verification of software implementations and products.</P>
    <P><B>Threat Modeling</B>. Using attack tree analysis, Counterpane Systems provides a comprehensive threat analysis of systems and products. This kind of analysis can determine a system's vulnerability and the avenues of attack most likely to succeed. We can calculate the time, money, and resources necessary to attack a system, determine the security effects of different business decisions, and list the security assumptions a system is based on. Attack trees can compare attacks and countermeasures, and isolate areas where security can most profitably be improved--or most profitably be attacked.</P>
    <P><B>Product Research and Forecasting</B>. Counterpane Systems assesses potential product ideas, and gives opinions on their viability in the marketplace. We also maintain a large database of competitive information, and can provide information on existing security-related products. We publish occasional reports on different areas of commercial cryptography--electronic commerce, Internet security, public-key infrastructure, secure tokens--and make these reports available to clients.</P>
    <P><B>Classes and Training</B>. Counterpane Systems provides a wide variety of training services, from hour-long tutorials on the basics of computer security to week-long classes on the mathematics of cryptography or the philosophy of secure system design. Other classes include advanced protocol design and analysis, Internet security protocols, public-key infrastructure, and electronic commerce security. Classes can be tailored to suit individual needs.</P>
    <P><B>Intellectual Property</B>. Counterpane Systems has considerable experience writing patent disclosures for cryptographic inventions. We provide opinions on patentability and prior art, and can help clients find new ways to implement systems which avoid infringing on existing patents. We maintain a database of more than 1000 cryptography-related patents.</P>
    <P><B>Export Consulting</B>. Counterpane Systems can help clients go through the process of receiving Commodity Jurisdictions from the U.S. Department of State, and get their products approved for export from the U.S. Department of Commerce.</P>
    <P><B>Theoretical and Applied Cryptographic Research</B>. Counterpane Systems continually pursues cryptographic research. By publishing papers at international academic conferences, we maintain our state-of-the-art knowledge and experience in cryptography.</P>
    <P><B>Clients</B>. Counterpane Systems has provided consulting services for clients on five continents, including American Express, Canon, Citibank, Compaq, Dallas Semiconductor, Disney, Hughes Data Systems, Intel, Intuit, MCI, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft, Mitsubishi, National Semiconductor, Netscape, NSA, Oracle, Security Dynamics, Silicon Graphics, Stac Electronics, Veridicom, Visa, and Xerox. Contracts range from short-term expert opinions and design evaluations to multi-year design and development efforts.</P>

He pioneered research on secure random number generators, differential related-key cryptanalysis on block ciphers, and the chosen-protocol attack against cryptographic protocols. His research has been presented at several international conferences, and he has broken many proposed commercial cryptographic algorithm, protocol, and system designs. He has a degree in economics and computer science from the University of Missouri in Columbia.</P>
    <P><B>CHRIS HALL</B> is experienced in mathematical cryptography (including elliptic curves), protocol design and analysis, and source-code security verification. He helped build various PGP products, including some cryptographic protocols and software in PGPfone. He discovered a major weaknesses in two different X Windows authentication schemes (the attacks and fixes weren't announced for six months so that major vendors could fix their software). Hall has a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Colorado in Boulder.</P>
    <P><B>DAVID WAGNER</B> is a graduate student in cryptography at the University of California Berkeley. His cryptographic expertise includes both algorithms and protocols.
