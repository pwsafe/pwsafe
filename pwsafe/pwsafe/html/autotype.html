<h2>Auto Type</h2>

		
<p><b>Auto Type</b>
provides a means for users to easily and quickly enter user name and
password information. With a single click, the user name, and password
are entered and the form submitted to the host for approval. By
default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes is as
follows: the user name, followed by a tab key, followed by the
password, another tab, and then the enter key (<i>username</i> <b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB </b><b>ENTER</b>). </p>
 Most, though not all, web forms will operate with the <b>Auto Type</b> feature. For those that don't, it is possible to tailor the autotype behaviour as described in the <a href="#autotype_details">Customizing Auto Type</a> section below.<br>



		
<div class="instr">
			<h3>Using Auto Type</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Place cursor in the form's user name field
				</li><li>Maximize or open Password Safe
				</li><li>Select a password entry
				</li><li><b>Ctrl -T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform Auto Type</b> to initiate.</li></ol>
<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing Auto Type</h3>
For web sites that do not have the username field followed by the
password field followed by the login button, you can modify the
behaviour by adding "autotype:" in an entry's Notes field, followed by
a string that specifies the desired behavior as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\u</span> is replaced by the username associated with the entry.&nbsp;</li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\p</span> is replaced by the password associated with the entry.&nbsp;</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\t</span> is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.&nbsp;</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\n</span> is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.&nbsp;</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\\</span> is replaced by the backslash (\) key.&nbsp;</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\d<span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span></span> sets the delay between characters to <span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span> milliseconds, instead of 10 (the default). <br>
</li><li>All other text is typed as-is.<br>
  </li>


</ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</span> The following can be used where the bank account number (12345) must be entered before the user and password:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; autotype:12345\t\u\t\p\t\n&nbsp;<br>
