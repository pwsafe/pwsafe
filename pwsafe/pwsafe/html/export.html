<h2>Exporting Entries</h2>




<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> supports exporting (and importing) of the stored
passwords to various formats. To export data use the
File-&gt;Export To menu. The supported formats are:</p>




<ul>




  <li>Password Safe v1 (for use by versions 1.x of Password Safe)</li>




  <li>Password Safe v2 (for use by versions 2.x of PasswordSafe)</li>




  <li><a href="#te">Plain text</a></li>




  <li><a href="#xml">XML</a></li>




</ul>




<p>For previous versions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span>, just select the desired format and specify the name of the database file
you wish to create.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> allows you to export password entries to
text files. These files may then be used or modified by other
applications.<br>



You will first be asked to enter the master password or safe
combination to confirm that you may export the database into a clear
text unencrypted file.<br>


<br>


</p>




<img style="width: 419px; height: 274px;" alt="Export Text" src="images%5Cexport.gif">
<p> You can also specify some options:</p>


<ul>


  <li>

    
    
    <p>Password entries will be exported with a tab character between
fields i.e., between the Group.Title, Username, Password and the Notes
fields. The "Group.Title" is considered a single field. Any field
containing a blank will be output inside double quotation characters.
Only the Notes field can contain multiple line entries. The normal
processing is to place each Notes line, if more than one, on a separate
line in the exported text field. However, this makes it difficult to
sort or to use when comparing two different export files. In order to
overcome this, should you need to, you may specify a delimiter to be
used to separate the multiple lines when exporting them. If you are
going to import the file into Password Safe at a later date and still
have a delimiter character, then it must be specified on the import or
all the Notes lines will appear as one single line in the resulting
database.<br>


If a Notes field multi-line delimiter character is required,
enter it here so that, during the Export process, multiple lines in
Notes field will be exported as a single line using this character
between each of the original lines.<br>


If required, tick that you want to put all separate lines
in the Notes field onto one line and enter the character to be used as
the delimiter. Since the whole Notes field is enclosed between double
quotation marks, this character is prohibited from being selected as
the multi-line delimiter.</p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    
    <p>A title row naming the columns,
e.g.,&nbsp;"Group/Title", "Username", "Password", etc., may be added by selecting the "Include a Title Row" checkbox.</p>




  </li>


</ul>


<p>Even more control on the exported format may be specified by clicking on "Advanced". The following dialog box will appear:</p>


<p><img style="width: 341px; height: 594px;" alt="Export Extra" src="images/export_extra.gif"></p>


<p>This dialog box allows you to&nbsp;export only some of the entries,
based on the text in specified fields, and/or specify which fields are
to be exported. Click OK when you have finished, or Cancel to return to
the Export Text dialog box without any changes.</p>


<p>
You will then be asked to supply the name of the new file and
to confirm overwriting a file of the same name if it already exists in
the directory you specified.</p>

<h3><a name="xml"></a>XML</h3>

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a popular format for transferring
data between applications. Password Safe can export (and import) the
database entries to this format. The structure (or <span style="font-style: italic;">schema</span>) against which the data is exported and validated is defined in the file <span style="font-style: italic;">pwsafe.xsd</span>,
which is provided as part of the distribution. This file is used by
Password Safe when XML data is imported, and should be provided to
applications that wish to use the exported data.<br>

The display of XML files is specified by <span style="font-style: italic;">pwsafe.xsl</span>
- an eXtensible Stylesheet Language file. A sample file, which may be
modified for your own needs, is supplied as part of the distribution.
This file is only an example and you can easily modify it to display
whatever fields you want to show.&nbsp; As this only displays the data
and will not alter it, you will still be able to import it into
Password Safe at some later time.
