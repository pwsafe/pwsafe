minute.

item.

common group or not.
[] It is now possible to import text files exported by KeePass.
[] The English online help file has been rewritten.

Known Problems:
===============
[879400] A category cannot be dragged to the top level. Workaround:

its entries Group fields from "a.b" to "b".

cause the program to pause that many milliseconds between characters
from that moment onwards.
[1032149] Adding an entry with a group or item selected will fill the

New Features for 2.0:
=====================
Two major new features in this release: A new database format, and a
new tree view. The former should be invisible to users, the latter
quite useful.

The application imports old database files transparently, and warns
the user upon saving that the new format is incompatible with old
versions of the program.

Also, the first URL in the Notes field (starting with http: or https:)
will be added to the popup (right-click) menu for that entry. 
Selecting it will invoke the default browser on that URL.

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim 
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me (https://sourceforge.net/users/ronys) know.

Finally, the graphics have been spruced up a bit - thanks to Emilijan
Mirceski for his patient work on the new logo and toolbar!

format) database now work correctly.

even when only the login window is displayed.

New Features for 2.0pre2:
=========================

plain ASCII file. Fields are separated by a tab character. Note that
this is a VERY large security risk if used carelessly.
