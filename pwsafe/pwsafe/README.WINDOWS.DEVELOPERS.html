<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>There are several 'degrees of freedom' for Windows developers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Development tools:&nbsp;Microsoft's Visual Studio <i>2010</i>
(referred to as 'VS2010' below) is currently the main development
environment, although Visual Studio 2005 (MSVS8) is currently also
supported. Visual Studio 2008 (MSVS9) should also work. See note below
for Visual Express users.</li>
<li>User interface library: The curently supported version of PasswordSafe for Windows
is built upon MFC (Microsoft's Foundation Classes). Work is also being done on a
wxWidgets version, which should provide cross platform support.</li>
<li>XML support: As PasswordSafe provides XML import/export capabilities, it
can be configured to use one of several XML parsers (or none).
The curently supported version of PasswordSafe for Windows is built using the
Microsoft XML parser. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note regarding Visual Express: The MFC version of PasswordSafe currently
<span style="font-weight: bold;">cannot </span>be built using Visual Express,
as Microsoft does not provide MFC support in this product. It should, however,
be possible to build the wxWidgets version.</p>

<p>To summarise: The 'official' version of PasswordSafe on Windows
platforms is based on&nbsp;MFC (Microsoft's Foundation Classes), and
uses&nbsp;Microsoft's XML parser. This&nbsp;corresponds to the <i>ReleaseM</i>
configuration in the build environment, i.e., the release build using Microsoft's
XML parser.  This will build the required DLLs using their Release configuration
(pws_at.dll for AutoType support and pws_osk.dll for the Virtual Keyboard) and
the base resource DLL (pwsafe_base.dll used to create non-English language support).</p>

<p>The current MFC configurations are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Debug</b> - builds the debug version of the required DLLs (pws_at_D.dll and pws_osk_D.dll).
This project is automatically selected when any of the debug builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>DebugE</b> - builds the debug version using the Expat XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugM</b> - builds the debug version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugX</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Release</b> - builds the release version of the required DLLs (pws_at.dll and pws_osk.dll)
and the resource DLL (pwsafe_base.dll). This project is automatically selected when any 
of the release builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>ReleaseE</b> - builds the release version using the Expat XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleaseM</b> - builds the release version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleaseX</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>

<p>The current wxWidgets configurations are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Debugwx</b> - builds the debug version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugwxE</b> - builds the debug version using the Expat XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugwxX</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Releasewx</b> - builds the release version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleasewxE</b> - builds the release version using the Expat XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleasewxX</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the corlib and os project files contain <i>all</i> of the above projects,
even if you are only selecting one of the MFC or the wxWidget builds. You should not
have to select them individually as selecting the main PasswordSafe 
configuration will select the correct configuration for these projects.  You should
also be careful not to select all configrations in the VS2010 Batch Build process
either to build, rebuild or clean all configurations.  Only select MFC configurations
if using the MFC PasswordSafe solution (pwsafe.sln) and the wxWdigets
configurations if using the wxWidgets PasswordSafe solution (pwsafe_wx.sln).</p>

<h3><a name="Software_Requirements"></a>Software Requirements</h3>

<h4>Getting Source code</h4>

<p>The source code for PasswordSafe may be downloaded as a zip file, or retrieved
from the Subversion repository at <a href="https://passwordsafe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/passwordsafe/trunk/pwsafe/pwsafe">
https://passwordsafe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/passwordsafe/trunk/pwsafe/pwsafe</a>
using a subversion client. Currently (August 2010), the Windows version
is built using Microsoft's development tools as described <a href="#Windows_Build">below</a>.</p>

<p>If you're going to commit code to the repository, please set your subversion client's
configuration file as follows:</p>

<p>In the "[miscellany]" section, ensure the following variable is set to 'yes':</p>
<pre>
  enable-auto-props = yes<br>
</pre>

<p>In the "[auto-props]" section, add the following if not already there:</p>

<p>(This file is ~/.subversion/config for Linux, and under Documents and
Settings\user\Application Data\Subversion\config on Windows.  If using Tortoise
SVN client under Windows, this can be accessed by right clicking a file, selecting 
Tortoise SVN and then select Settings from the menu and using the Edit button in the
General Settings panel).</p>

<h4><a name="Windows_Build"></a>Windows Build</h4>

<p>The Windows version of PasswordSafe can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 (C++ compiler for PaswordSafe ('VC10') and C# compiler if you wish to re-generate
the Virtual Keyboard data, which is not normally necessary). Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
(MSVS8) and 2008 are also supported, as described below. The VC10 Express compiler
does <u>not</u> support Microsoft's Foundation Classes, which are used extensively
within the current official Windows version.&nbsp;</p><p>The main (toplevel) Microsoft 
Visual Studio 2010 solution file is pwsafe.sln. The MSVS8 version is pwsafe<span style="font-weight: bold;">8</span>.sln.
Likewise, the other solution files in this project have "8" appended to the MSVS8 versions.</p>

<p>In order to build the Windows version of PasswordSafe, you
need to install the following freely available components, in addition to
Visual Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd146047.aspx">
Microsoft's Windows SDK</a>. If you have installed Visual Studio 2008,
it will have installed a Windows SDK V6.0A and you do not have to install
another SDK. If you haven't installed VS2008, then please select either
of the following versions:
<ul>
<li>"Windows Vista Update &amp; .NET 3.0 SDK"
[V6.1.6000.16384.10 dated February 2007] - known as V6.0.</li>
<li>"Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5"
[V6.0.6001.18000.367 dated February 2008] - known as V6.1.</li>
<li>"Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
[V6.1.7600.16385 dated August 2009] - known as V7.0.</li>
</ul>
All these replace the old "Platform SDK" and support Operating
Systems: Vista and Windows XP; and Development Environments: Visual
Studio 2005 and 2008. However, V7.0 and later support Windows 7 <b>but not</b>
Visual Studio 2005. At this time, PasswordSafe does not use any facilities or
functions that are not supported by Windows XP and Visual Studio 2005.
<br>
By default, the SDKs are installed in directory "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN", where NNN is '6.0', '6.0A', '6.1' or '7.0'.
<u>See note below.</u></li>
<li>To compile and produce the Help files (.chm) then
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-%0D%0Ac8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&amp;DisplayLang=en">
Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop</a> is required. Note however that the headers and
libraries necessary for compiling PasswordSafe itself are included in the
Windows SDK mentioned above.</li>
<li>A subversion client, such as <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">
Tortoise SVN Client</a> (for updating the revision number within PasswordSafe's
version details)</li>
<li>For XML Support, one or more of the following is needed (see the
<a href="#XML_Processing"> XML processing section</a> for more details):
<ul>
<li>Headers and libraries to support Microsoft's XML V6.0 are included in
the Windows SDK mentioned above and do not need to be installed separately.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat's V2.0.1
XML Library</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces
V3.1.1 XML Library</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>SDK NOTE:</b> In order to compile PasswordSafe using MFC,
the Microsoft Windows SDK's 'include' and 'lib' directories
must be added to the directories supplied by Visual Studio 2005. This is
achieved in VS2005 via Tools &gt; Options &gt; Project and Solutions
&gt; VC++ directories &gt; Include files and Library files.
They can be added at the end of each appropriate set using the directory you
specified during installation (the defaults are: "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN\Include" and "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN\Lib", where NNN is 6.0, 6.0A, 6.1 or 7.0 as
noted above). The Microsoft Visual Studio Registration Tool only adds
the .Net libraries and not those needed for PasswordSafe. <b>It is
recommended that you get SDK V6.1 <u>and</u> you place them above the
libraries supplied with Visual Studio e.g. "$(VCInstallDir)PlatformSDK\include"
and "$(VCInstallDir)PlatformSDK\lib" otherwise you may get warning messages
compiling source members using BlockInput.</b></p>

<p><b>Compiling using Visual Studio:</b> If you're using Microsoft's Visual
Studio, the file&nbsp;"UserVariables.props" (for VS10) or "UserVariables.vsprops"
(for VS8) <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> exist and describe the directories where
the non-"Windows SDK" components have been installed. <b><u><i>The solution
will not open correctly without this file being present</i></u></b>.
For your convenience, we've included a simple Visual Basic script, "configure.vbs"
(or "configure8.vbs" for VS8) in the src/ui/Windows directory, that you can
run to generate the above file with the correct values.</p>

<p><i>This version uses zLib to compress attachments before adding to the attachment
file and decompress them on extraction.  This uses two assembler source routines
(inffas32.asm and match686.asm), but Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition was supplied
 without the assembler program (ml.exe) for x86 builds. The web page:

provides a work-around. The contents of this page states:

the Express Edition of 2005. The Express Edition's setup program from the above link is
named MASMSetup.exe. Using a program that can extract '.cab' files, like WinRAR/7-Zip, open
MASMSetup.exe as a '.cab' file and extract its 'setup.exe'.  Then open this file also
as a '.cab' file and extract file 'vc_masm1.cab', then once again open it.  Extract the
only file inside it, which has a long name starting with "FL_ml_exe".  Rename this to
"ml.exe" and place it into "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin".

<h4><a name="Linux_Build"></a>Linux Build</h4>

<p>The Linux version of PasswordSafe is currently in pre-Alpha state. It is
being built under Debian 5.0 (Lenny), and uses uuid-dev and
libwxgtk2.8-dev for building, as well as g++ and GNU make.</p>

<h3><a name="XML_Processing"></a>XML Processing</h3>

<p>Originally, PasswordSafe used Microsoft's XML library for XML parsing and
validation. For portability, we're now working on support for the
<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Expat</a>
and <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/" target="_blank">Xerces</a> XML
libraries, which are available for non-Windows platforms.  We recommend the
latest version (currently 3.1.1 as of April 2010), as they
supply pre-built Windows binaries using the VS2005 (VC8) and VC9 and VC10
compilers.</p>

<p>To determine which XML library to use while building PasswordSafe,
we've defined a pre-processor variable (USE_XML_LIBRARY). If <u>NOT</u>
defined, the compiled PasswordSafe <u>will not process XML files</u>
(databases or filter definitions in XML format). Filters within a database
will be treated as 'Unknown Fields' and will remain unchanged so that
other versions of PasswordSafe that do support XML parsing can still
use them. Note, however, that the application will be able to write XML files.</p>

<p>The three valid values of the USE_XML_LIBRARY variable are "EXPAT",
"MSXML" and "XERCES" corresponding to the three different implementations.
For wxWidgets builds, only EXPAT and XERCES will be possible but they are
still under development (as of August 2010).</p>

<p>PasswordSafe uses SAX2 processing for both Microsoft's and the Xerces' XML
Parsers, which are full validating parsers and require the presence of
the appropriate XSD Schema file (included in the distribution and in the
"xml" sub-directory, to process either file or filter imports. This
ensures that the data eventually hitting the SAX2 content handlers is
correct and just needs placing in the appropriate fields.</p>

<p>Expat is a non-validating XML Parser and uses its own API rather than SAX2.
Note: SAX2 is only an official standard for Java XML processing,
although many C supporting parsers also support this interface. Because
Expat is non-validating, significant extra code has been added directly into
PasswordSafe to perform this validation, so that the program and its 
databases are not corrupted by poorly formed XML or incorrect data within
the XML file.</p>

<h3><a name="Minidump_Production"></a>Minidump Production (Windows only)</h3>

<p>In order to help debug user problems when Windows just says "there has
been an error", a "Windows Unhandled Fault Handler" has been added. This will
create a minidump, which can then be used to find where the error took
place and, hopefully, why.</p>

<p>An extra "extended" Command Line flag of "--testdump" has been introduced
for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the developer to test the minidump process,
which is only available in the Release version of the executable and,
secondly, allows the translators to check that the error screen displays
as they wish.</p>

<p><u>Note to Translators:</u> the error screen is a basic Windows function
and has a fixed width. This is the reason why the minidump file name and
directory have been split onto separate lines.</p>

<p><u>Note: Extended flags start with two minus signs ('--') and must be
specified in full - i.e. no abbreviations. They are not displayed in the
Usage notes for the normal users and no error message or display is shown
if they are not recognised.</u></p>

<p>With this flag set, an extra button will appear in the bottom right
hand corner of the "About PasswordSafe" dialog. Click it, and a minidump
should be produced.</p>

<p>In order to process the minidump, either the free Microsoft Windbg
program can be used (see Microsoft's site for details), or Visual Studio
(VS) can be used. In the latter case (and probably the former too!):</p>
<ol>
<li>You need the source corresponding to the failing release
version. This should be available from SourceForge web site either in
the normal Download section or from the Subversion repository, based on
the revision number associated with that release. Without the
corresponding source, VS can only show Windows source and line numbers in
PasswordSafe source. With the corresponding source, VS can show you the
exact line in PasswordSafe where the error took place and also the other
statements within PasswordSafe as you follow the stack trace.</li>
<li>You need the Program Debug Database (pwsafe.pdb) associated with the
failing release. This is not normally uploaded to the SourceForge web
site with the release package. It is large (~11.5MB or ~3MB
compressed). Since this must correspond to the PasswordSafe executable that
had the error, maybe this and, possibly, the associated Link Map can be
uploaded to a Developers section on this web site to aid all developers.</li>
<li>You should probably maintain the directory structure of the project
as described in the source downloaded from SourceForge and place the
Program Debug Database file in the '..\src\bin\releasem' directory.</li>
<li>Save the user's minidump file on your PC. Use VS to Open this <u>as
a Project</u> (e.g. File-&gt;Open-&gt;Project/Solution).</li>
<li>In the Debugging Options, specify the directory containing the corresponding
PDB file. (Go to: Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Debugging-&gt;Symbols and add
this directory in the section entitled "Symbol file (.pdb)
locations:").</li>
<li>Press F5 to start debugging, and away you go.</li>
</ol>
