1. Introduction: The format described below has the following goals:
a. To fix a minor design flaw in previous versions of the PasswordSafe
database format.
b. To replace the underlying cryptographic functions with more advanced
versions.
c. To allow detection of a truncated or corrupted/tampered database.

Meeting these goals is impossible without breaking compatibility: The new
format will NOT be compatible with existing implementations.

2. Format: A V3 format PasswordSafe will be structured as follows:

TAG|SALT|ITER|H(P')|B1|B2|B3|B4|IV|HDR|R1|R2|...|Rn|EOF|HMAC

Where:

2.1 TAG is the sequence of 4 ASCII characters "PWS3". This is to serve as a
quick way for the application to identify the database as a PasswordSafe
version 3 file. This tag has no cryptographic value. Changing or
removing it will cause the database to be unreadable, and adding it to a
non-database file will only cause the application to attempt to validate
the passphrase as described below.

2.1 SALT is a 256 bit random value, generated at file creation time.

2.3 P' is the "stretched key" of the user's passphrase and the SALT, as
defined by the hash-function-based key stretching algorithm in
http://www.schneier.com/paper-low-entropy.pdf (Section 4.1), with SHA-256
as the hash function, and ITER iterations (at least 2048, i.e., t = 11).

2.4 ITER is the number of iterations on the hash function to calculate P',
stored as a 32 bit little-endian value. This value is stored here in order
to future-proof the file format against increases in processing power.

2.5 H(P') is SHA-256(P'), and is used to verify that the user has the
correct passphrase.

2.6 B1 and B2 are two 128-bit blocks encrypted with Twofish using P' as the
key, in ECB mode. These blocks contain the 256 bit random key K that is
used to encrypt the actual records. (This has the property that there is no
known or guessable information on the plaintext encrypted with the
passphrase-derived key that allows an attacker to mount an attack that
bypasses the key stretching algorithm.)

2.7 B3 and B4 are two 128-bit blocks encrypted with Twofish using P' as the
key, in ECB mode. These blocks contain the 256 bit random key L that is
used to calculate the HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) of the
encrypted data. See description of EOF field below for more details.
Implementation Note: K and L must NOT be related.

2.8 IV is the 128-bit random Initial Value for CBC mode.

2.9 All following records are encrypted using Twofish in CBC mode, with K
as the encryption key.

2.9.1 HDR: The database header. All data in the header is written in
fields, as defined in Section 3. The first field contains the version
number of the database format. For this version, the value is 0x0300
(stored in little-endian format, that is, 0x00, 0x03). The type of this
field is zero.  The next field is the database's UUID, stored as 16
bytes. The type of this field is 0x01 (as defined in Section 3.1).
Following this, non-default user preferences are written as a string (as
described below), with field type value set to 0x02.  Currently, no further
data is written. To allow further enhancements, the database header is
terminated by an empty field of type 'END'. This will allow older versions
of the program to skip over records that may be added over time to the
header.

2.9.1.1 Non-default preferences are encoded in a string as follows: The
string is of the form "X nn vv X nn vv..." Where X=[BIS] for binary,
integer and string, resp., nn is the numeric value of the enum, and vv is
the value, {1.0} for bool, unsigned integer for int, and quoted string for
String. Only values != default are stored. See PWSprefs.cpp for more
details.

2.9.2 R1..Rn: The actual database records. Each record consists of one or
more typed fields (as defined in Section 3), terminated by the 'END' type
field. The UUID, Title, and Password fields are mandatory. All
non-mandatory fields may either be absent or have zero length. When a field
is absent or zero-length, its default value shall be used.

2.10 EOF: The ASCII characters "PWS3-EOFPWS3-EOF" (note that this is exactly
one block long), unencrypted. This is an implementation convenience to
inform the application that the following bytes are to be processed
differently.

2.11 HMAC: The 256-bit keyed-hash MAC, as described in RFC2104, with
SHA-256 as the underlying hash function. The value is calculated over all
of the plaintext fields, that is, over all the data stored in all fields
(starting from the version number in the header, ending with the last field
of the last record). The key L as stored in B3 and B4 is used as the hash
key value.

3. Fields: Data in PasswordSafe is stored in typed fields. Each field
consists of one or more blocks. The blocks are the blocks of the underlying
encryption algorithm - 16 bytes long for Twofish. The first block contains
the field length in the first 4 bytes (little-endian), followed by a
one-byte type identifier. The rest of the block contains up to 11 bytes of
record data. If the record has less than 11 bytes of data, the extra bytes
are filled with random values. The type of a field also defines the data
representation.

3.1 Field types (based on the v2 format):
							             Currently
   Name			      value	    Type     Implemented Comments
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   UUID			      0x01		UUID		Y	[1]
   Group		      0x02		Text		Y	[2]
   Title		      0x03		Text		Y
   Username		      0x04		Text		Y
   Notes		      0x05		Text		Y
   Password		      0x06		Text		Y
   Creation Time	  0x07		time_t		Y   [3]
   Password Modification
   Time               0x08      time_t      N
   Last Access Time   0x09		time_t		N	[4]
   Password Lifetime  0x0a		time_t		N	[5]
   Password Policy    0x0b		4 bytes		N	[6]
   Last Mod. time     0x0c		time_t		N	[7]
   URL                0x0d      Text		Y	[8]
   Autotype           0x0e      Text        Y   [9]
   End of Entry       0xff		[empty]		Y	[10]

[1] A universally unique identifier is needed in order to synchronize
databases, i.e., between a handheld pocketPC device and a PC. The UUID data
type is 16 bytes long, as defined in RFC4122. Windows has functions for
this, and the RFC has a sample implementation.

[2] The "Group" supports displaying the entries in a tree-like
manner. Groups can be heirarchical, with elements separated by a period,
supporting groups such as "Finance.credit cards.Visa", "Finance.credit
cards.Mastercard", Finance.bank.web access", etc. Dots entered by the user
should be "escaped" by the application.

[3] Timestamps are stored as 32 bit, little endian, unsigned integers,
representing the number of seconds since Midnight, January 1, 1970,
GMT. (This is equivalent to the time_t type on Windows and POSIX.  On the
Macintosh, the value needs to be adjusted by the constant value 2082844800
to account for the different epoch of its time_t type.)

[4] This will be updated whenever the password of this entry is copied
to the clipboard, or whenever the Password Modification Time is
updated.

[5] This will allow the user to enter a lifetime for an entry. The
application can then prompt the user about passwords that need to be
changed. Password lifetime is in seconds, and a value of zero means
"forever".

[6] Currently, the password policy is a global property. It makes
sense, however, to want to control this on a per-entry basis. Four
bytes seems sufficient to store the policy. Exact encoding TBD.

[7] This is the time that any field of the record was modified, useful
for merging databases.

[8] The URL will be passed to the shell when the user chooses the "Browse
to" action for this entry. In version 2 of the format, this was extracted
from the Notes field. By placing it in a separate field, we are no longer
restricted to a URL - any action that may be executed by the shell may be
specified here.

[9] The text to be 'typed' by PasswordSafe upon the "Perform
Autotype" action maybe specified here. If unspecified, the default value of
'username, tab, password, tab, enter' is used. In version 2 of the format,
this was extracted from the Notes field. Several codes are recognized here,
e.g, '%p' is replaced by the record's password. See the user documentation
for the complete list of codes. The replacement is done by the application
at runtime, and is not stored in the database.

[10] An explicit end of entry field is useful for supporting new fields
without breaking backwards compatability.
