<p>Through the <b>Edit Menu</b> you can add, edit,
use and organize
user names and passwords. Note that the contents of this menu change
according to what's selected in the main view (e.g., if you've selected
and entry or a group). Also, some items may be disabled, as noted below.</p>

<div class="instr">
<h3>Add Entry</h3>

<p>Add a new user name and password. This is disabled if the
database is opened read-only.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="entering_pwd.html">User
Names, Passwords, and Groups</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Edit Entry / Expand/Collapse Group</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, Edit the selected user name and
password.
When a Group is selected (in Tree view), this will expand or collapse
the display of entries under the selected group. Editing an entry is
disabled if the database is opened read-only.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="entering_pwd.html">User
Names, Passwords, and Groups</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Delete Entry / Delete Group</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, this will delete it.&nbsp;When
a Group is
selected (in Tree view), this will delete all entries under the
selected group. Confirmation is requested if there is more than one
entry in the selected group. This is disabled if the database
is opened read-only.</p>

<h3>Rename Entry / Rename Group</h3>

<p>Rename the selected entry (or group, in Tree
view). This is disabled if the database is opened read-only. </p>

<h3>Find Entry</h3>

<p>Find an entry containing a given text. By default, all fields
except the Password field are searched.<br>

<small style="font-style: italic;">See <a href="searching.html">Searching</a> for more
information.</small></p>

<h3>Duplicate Entry</h3>

<p>Duplicates the selected entry. This is disabled if
the database is opened read-only.</p>

<h3>Add Group</h3>

<p>Create a new password group (e.g., Banking
Passwords). This is disabled if the database is opened
read-only.</p>

<h3>Clear Clipboard</h3>

<p>Clear the clipboard's memory. This clears the clipboard of
anything that was pasted there by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password
Safe</span> (password, username, notes, etc.).
If the current contents of the clipboard did not come from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span>, then
this will have no effect.</p>

<h3>Copy Password to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's password to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy User Name to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy current selection's user name to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy Notes to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the contents of current selection's notes field to the
clipboard.</p>

<h3>Copy URL to Clipboard</h3>

<p>Copy the current selection's URL field to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Browse to URL</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, and the entry has a URL associated
with
it, then this will invoke the default browser to the URL. If no entry
is selected, or the selected entry's URL is blank, this command will be
disabled.</p>

<h3>Perform Auto Type</h3>

<p>Automatically input user name and password into the selected
input field.<br>

<small><i>See <a href="autotype.html">Using
Auto Type</a> for more information.</i></small></p>

<h3>Create Shortcut</h3>

<p>When an entry is selected, this allows you to create a
reference to the entry, typically in another group. This is useful if
you have an entry that "belongs" under more than one group, but you
don't wish to duplicate data. A shortcut has a distinct icon associated
with it, <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="shortcut" src="images/shortcut.jpg">, and by
default has the name "shortcut to <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>",
where <span style="font-style: italic;">x </span>is
the title of the original entry. Of course, you can edit the name, move
or delete the shortcut, just like a regular entry.</p>

</div>

<h2>Right mouse click actions </h2>

<table class="MsoNormalTable" style="border: medium none ; border-collapse: collapse;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td ;="" align="center">Entry</td>

      <td style="width: 10px;"></td>

      <td ;="" align="center">Alias</td>

      <td style="width: 10px;"></td>

      <td ;="" align="center">Group</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td><img alt="Right click Edit Entry" src="images/rightclick_edit_e.jpg"></td>

      <td></td>

      <td><img alt="Right click Edit Alias" src="images/rightclick_edit_ex.jpg"></td>

      <td></td>

      <td><img alt="Right click Edit Group" src="images/rightclick_edit_g.jpg"></td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Many of the functions in the <b>Edit</b> menu can
also be
reached by clicking the right mouse button on the corresponding
entry or group. Here we'll describe only those functions that
haven't been mentioned&nbsp;in&nbsp;the <a href="#edit_menu">previous
section</a>.</p>

<div class="instr">
<h3>Display subset of Password</h3>

<p>This action displays a window that allows you to specify which
characters of a password to display. This is useful for sites that ask
for parts of a password to login. For example, a password might be
"qAdm3ddENc", and you might be asked to enter the first, third, fifth
and eighth letters. This window allows you to do this in a convenient
manner: In the upper field you enter the positions of the
password characters you want for the subset of the password. You can
use spaces, commas or semi-colons to separate the positions. The
corresponding characters of the password are shown in the lower field.
To quit, please use the <b>Esc</b> key.</p>

<h3>Go to Base entry</h3>

<p>This item will only appear for a shortcut or alias entry.
After clicking <b>Go to Base entry</b> the corresponding
base entry will be selected.</p>
