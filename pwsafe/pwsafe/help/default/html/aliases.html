<h3>Password Aliases</h3>


<p>If you're using a "single sign-on" system that allows you to share
the same password across different machines/servers/applications, etc.
you can setup <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span>
entries accordingly, so that changing one password affects all other
related entries. This is called "aliasing" entries. This section describes how to define and use such aliases.</p>


<h4>Summary</h4>


<p>The basic idea is to allow one entry's password to be referred to
by another. The "referred to" entry is called the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">base</span>, and the
"referring" entry (or entries) is (are) called the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">alias(es)</span>.
When an entry is set to be the alias of another entry, the alias's
password effectively "follows" that entry's password: If you copy the
alias' password to the clipboard, the password that gets copied is
the base's. If you change the base's password, this is immediately
reflected in all the alias entries associated with the base. Although
this may sound complicated, in fact it's quite simple and intuitive to
use. The hardest part is setting up the aliases, as described below.</p>


<h4>Defining an alias</h4>


<p>In Password Safe, an entry can refer to another's password by means
of a specially formatted password in the referring entry. The format is
the "name" of the referred-to entry enclosed in square brackets. "Name"
in this context means all of the following fields, separated by colons:
Group, Title and User name. Note that if the title is unique in the
database, then the
other fields are optional. Likewise, if the group and
title together or title and user together specify a unique entry, then
the corresponding user or group doesn't have to be
specified.</p>


<p>In Password Safe, only the Title field is mandatory.  Group and User name 
fields are optional as long as the resulting combination of "group/title/user&nbsp;name"
is unique. As indicated above, the alias' "password" is in the form [g:t:u] but
in fact you only have to specify enough information to uniquely identify
the base entry.  So, if there is only one entry in the database with title 't',
then [t] would be sufficient - since title is mandatory and only one item is given,
it is assumed to be the title.  If there were more than one entry with this title,
you would be warned that this is the case, and you would need to be more specific to
identify the base entry by adding either its group or its user name or both!
As long as there is a unique entry that fits the information provided, any of
the following formats are accepted: [g:t:u], [g:t], [t:u] or [t].  Specifying a
colon without a value implies an empty field, e.g. [g:t:] says entry with
title 't' in group 'g' and with no user name value and [:t:] says entry with 
title 't' in the root with no user name value etc.</p>


<p>The following examples should make this clear.</p>


<h4>Examples</h4>


<p>1. If the base entry's title is "LDAP Server", and there are no
other entries with that title, then an alias will be defined by an
entry that has "[LDAP Server]" in the password field.</p>


<p>2. If there are "LDAP Server" entries in two different groups, say
"Dept. A" and "Dept. B", then one can specify an alias to the latter by
"[Dept. A:LDAP Server]". Note you do not have to specify the user name if 
the information you have provided uniquely identifies the base entry.</p>


<p>3. Different user names can also be used to differentiate between
similar base entries, e.g., "[LDAP Server:Joe]" and "[LDAP
Server:Mary]".</p>


<p>4. Finally, all three fields may be specified, as in "[Dept. A:LDAP Server:Joe]"</p>


<h4>Display</h4>


<p>Base entries, that is, entries with at least one alias "pointing" to
them, are displayed with a green triangle instead of a green square in
the nested tree view.</p>


<p>Alias entries are shown with white triangles.</p>
