<h2>Auto Type</h2>

<p><b>Auto Type </b>provides a means for users to easily and quickly
enter user name and password information. With a single click, the user
name and password are entered and the data is submitted to the host for
approval. By default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes
is as follows: <a name="defautotext">the user name, followed by a tab
key, followed by the password, another tab, and then the enter key</a>
(<i>username</i> <b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB ENTER</b>). This works
fine for most web sites that require username/password authentication.</p>

<p>For web sites or applications that require different data, it
is possible to tailor the autotype behaviour as described in the
<a href="#autotype_details">Customizing Auto Type</a> section below.
Note that you can also customize the <i><a href="#defautotext">default</a></i>
autotype text via the <i><a href="misc_tab.html">Misc.</a></i> tab in
the Options dialog box. This can be useful if, for example, the
autotype is too fast for your machine.</p>

<h3>Using Auto Type</h3>

<ol>
<li>Place cursor in the form's user name field</li>
<li>Maximize or open <b>Password Safe</b></li>
<li>Select a password entry</li>
<li><b>Ctrl -T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform Auto Type</b>
or click on the Toolbar button to initiate.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing Auto Type</h3>

<p>For web sites or applications that do not have the username
field followed by the password field followed by the login button,
you can modify the behaviour by filling in the <a href="#N1">"Autotype" field</a>
with text that specifies the desired behavior as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>\u</b> is replaced by the username associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\p</b> is replaced by the password associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\g</b> is replaced by the group associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\i</b> is replaced by the title associated with the entry.</li>
<li><b>\o</b> is replaced by the contents of the (possibly multilined) Notes field.</li>
<ul>
<li>Any end of line characters '\n', '\r' or '\r\n' are converted to '\r'
(carriage return).</li>
<li>No substitution is made to escape sequences within the Notes field 
(e.g. '\u', '\p' etc.) except for the '\t' sequence which is
replaced by the tab character.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>\o<i>NNN</i></b> is replaced by the contents of the n<sup>th</sup>
line of the Notes field</li>
<ul>
<li><i>NNN</i> can be one to three digits (e.g., \o5 for the 5<sup>th</sup>
line, \o45 for the 45<sup>th</sup>, etc.</li>
<li>End of line characters are <i>not </i> included.</li>
<li>if <i>NNN </i>is larger than the number of lines in the notes field,
then this has no effect.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<small><b>Note</b> that this is a convenient way to support
autotyping for applications that require a second password or other
arbitrary text as part of the authentication process.</small>

<hr>
<li><b>\b</b> is replaced by the backspace key.</li>
<li><b>\t</b> is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.</li>
<li><b>\n</b> is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.</li>
<li><b>\\</b> is replaced by the backslash (\) key.</li>
<li><b>\d<i>NNN</i></b> sets the delay between characters to <i>NNN</i>
milliseconds, instead of 10 (the default). This changes the delay for the current and
all subsequent characters. For example, "fast\d500slow" will result in
'fast' being typed with the default delay, and the letters 's', 'l',
'o', and 'w' typed with a half-second pause before each. if you want to
put in a one-time delay that does not affect the speed of the following
characters, use '\w' or '\W', as described below.</li>
<li><b>\w<i>NNN</i> or <i>\WNNN</i></b> introduces a delay of <i>NNN</i> milliseconds
for \w, or seconds if \W is used. For example, "how\w500now" will cause
'how' to be typed (at the default rate or that specified by the last
\d), followed by a half-second pause, followed by 'now' typed at the
same rate as 'how'). Likewise, "how\W2now" will introduce a two second
pause between the two words. This is useful for fine-tuning the timing with certain web pages.</li>
<li><b>\z</b> invokes the old AutoType mechanism.  This mechanism may handle
non-Latin characters incorrectly, but can make Autotype work on certain problematical web sites.
If you find that Autotype does not work properly on a particular web site, try this code in the
autotype command field.</li>
<li>All other text is typed as-is.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example:</b>
The following can be used where the bank account number (12345) must be
entered before the user and password:<a name="N1"></a>
<pre>
<i>12345\t\u\t\p\t\n</i>
</pre>
</p>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> If you are having problems with autotype, you might want to disable
3rd-party popup-blockers. Users have reported problems with the
interaction of popup-blockers with the autotype functionality.</small>
