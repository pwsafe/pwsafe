<h1>Developer Notes</h1>

<h3>Additional Software Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to build the Windows version of Password Safe, you need to install
the following freely available components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&DisplayLang=en">Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop</a> (for online help support)</li>
<li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">Tortoise SVN Client</a> (for updating the revision number within Password Safe's version details)</li>
<li>For XML Support, one or more of the following is needed:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=993C0BCF-3BCF-4009-BE21-27E85E1857B1&displaylang=en">Microsoft's XML V6.0 SDK [File: "msxml6_SDK.msi" on this page]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat's V2.0.1 XML Library</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces V3.0.0 XML Library</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>If you're using Microsoft's Visual Studio, the file "UserVariables.vsprops"
<b><u><i>must</i></u></b> exist and point to the directories where the above
components have been installed. <b><u><i>The solution will not open correctly without
this file being present.</i></u></b></p>

<p>For your convenience, we've included a simple Visual Basic script, 
"configure.vbs", that you can run to generate the "UserVariables.vsprops" file
with the correct values.</p>

<h3>XML Processing</h3>
<p>Originally, PasswordSafe used Microsoft's XML library 
for XML parsing and validation. For portability, we're now working on support
for the Expat and Xerces XML libraries, which are available for non-Windows
platforms.  See their web sites for more information.  Note: Xerces V3.0.0 
at revision 707374 or greater is needed to correct a memory leak processing 
password history entries.</p>

<p>To determine which XML library to use while building PasswordSafe,
we've defined a new preprocessor variable (USE_XML_LIBRARY). If <u>NOT</u>
defined, the compiled Password Safe <u>will not process XML files</u>
(databases or filter definitions in XML format). Filters within a
database will be treated as 'Unknown Fields' and will remain unchanged
so that other versions of Password Safe that do support XML parsing
can still use them. Note, however, that the application will be able
to write XML files.</p>

<p>The three valid values of the USE_XML_LIBRARY variable are "EXPAT", "MSXML"
and "XERCES" corresponding to the three different implementations.</p>

<p>Password Safe uses SAX2 processing for both Microsoft's and the Xerces'
XML Parsers, which are full validating parsers and require the presence of
the appropriate XSD Schema file (included in the distribution and in the "xml"
sub-directorty, to process either file or filter imports.  This ensures
that the data eventually hitting the SAX2 content handlers is correct and just
needs placing in the appropriate fields.</p>

<p>Expat is a non-validating XML Parser and uses its own API rather than SAX2.
Note: SAX2 is only an official standard for Java XML processing, although many C
supporting parsers also support this interface.  Because Expat is
non-validating, code is being added directly into Password Safe to
perform this validation, so that the program and its databases are
not corrupted by poorly formed XML or incorrect data within the XML file.</p>

<p>Note: As of 1 December 2008, the additional validation code for Expat and
non-Unicode versions of all three implementations are in progress.  Work
is also needed to ensure that error processing is correct and that associated
messages are produced correctly.</p>

<h3>Minidump Production</h3>

<p>In order to help debug user problems when Windows justs says "there has
been an error", a "Windows Unhandled Fault Handler" has been added. This will
create a minidump, which can then be used to find where the error took place
and, hopefully, why.</p>

<p>An extra "extended" Command Line flag of "--testdump" has been introduced
for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the developer to test the minidump process,
which is only available in the Release version of the executable and, secondly,
allows the translators to check that the error screen displays as they wish.
<u>Note to Translators:</u> the error screen is a basic Windows function and has a
fixed width. This is the reason why the minidump file name and directory have been
split onto separate lines.</p>

<p><u>Note: Extended flags start with two minus signs ('--') and must be specified
in full - i.e. no abbreviations.  They are not displayed in the Usage notes for
the normal users and no error message or display is shown if they are not
recognised.</u></p>

<p>With this flag set, there will appear an extra button in the bottom right
hand corner of the "About PasswordSafe" dialog.  Click it, and a minidump should
be produced.<p>

<p>In order to process the minimdump, either the free Microsoft Windbg program can be
used (see Microsoft's site for details), or Visual Studio (VS) can be used.  In the
latter case (and probably the former too!):
<ol>
<li>You need the source corresponding to the failing release version.  This should be
available from SourceForge web site either in the normal Download section or based
on the revision number associated with that release. Without the corresponding source,
VS can only show Windows source and line numbes in PasswordSafe source.  With the
corresponding source, VS can show you the exact line in PasswordSafe where the error
took place and also the other statements within PasswordSafe as you follow the stack
trace.</li>
<li>You need the Program Debug Database (pwsafe.pdb) associated with the failing release.
This is not normally uploaded to the SourceForge web site with the release
package.  It is large (~11.5MB or ~3MB compressed).  Since this must correspond
to the PasswordSafe executable that had the error, maybe this and, possibly, the
associated Link Map can be uploaded to a Developers section on this web site to aid
all developers.</li>
<li>You should probably maintain the directory structure of the project as described
in the source downloaded from SourceForge and place the Program Debug Database file
in the '..\src\bin\releasem' directory.</li>
<li>Save the user's minidump file on your PC.  Use VS to Open this <u>as a
Project</u> (e.g. File->Open->Project/Solution).</li>
<li>In the Debugging Options, specify the directory containing the corresponding PDB file.
(Go to: Tools->Options->Debugging->Symbols and add this directory in the section
entitled "Symbol file (.pdb) locations:").</li>
<li>Press F5 to start debugging and away you go.</li>
</ol>
