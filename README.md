Introduction
============
Password Safe is a password database utility. Like many other such
products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an
encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "master
password"), instead of all the username/password combinations that
you use.

What makes Password Safe different? Three things:
1. Simplicity: Password Safe is designed to do one thing, and to do it
well. Start the application, enter your "master password", double-click on
the entry and the password is now on your clipboard, ready for pasting.
2. Security: The original version was [designed by Bruce Schneier.](https://www.schneier.com/academic/passsafe/)
3. Open Source: The source code for the project is available for
inspection. For more information, see https://pwsafe.org.

The current version of Password Safe currently runs on Windows 7 and
later. Older versions are still available supporting Windows 95, 98,
ME, NT, 2000, XP, Vista as well as PocketPC.

The Mac version of Password Safe runs on macOS version 10.14 Mojave
and later, and runs native on Intel and Apple Silicon. (Universal binary.)

Linux packages are available for popular distributions. See
README.LINUX.md for more details.

FreeBSD is also supported. See README.FREEBSD.

Installation
============
For convenience, Password Safe is packaged into an executable
installer program. This installs the program, sets up shortcuts and
allows you to uninstall the program from the Windows Control
Panel. However, if you prefer, the -bin.zip file contains all the
files you need. Just extract the files (using WinZip, for example) to
any directory, double-click on the Pwsafe.exe icon,and that's
it. You may want to create a shortcut to your desktop and/or Start
menu. Finally, a Microsoft installer (.msi) package is also
available.

standard [Artistic License 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/artistic-2-0)". For more details, see the LICENSE
