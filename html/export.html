<h2>Exporting Entries</h2>

<p>Password Safe allows you to export password information to
text files. These files may then be used or modified by other
applications.</p>

<p>You will first be asked to enter the master password or safe
combination to confirm that you may export the database into a clear
text unencrypted file.</p>

<p>You will then be asked to supply the name of the new file and
to confirm overwriting a file of the same name if it already exists in
the directory you specify.</p>

<h3>The Notes field</h3>

<p>Password entries will be exported with a tab character between
fields i.e., between the Group.Title, Username, Password and the Notes
fields. The "Group.Title" is considered a single field. Any field
containing a blank will be output inside double quotation characters.
Only the Notes field can contain multiple line entries. The normal
processing is to place each Notes line, if more than one, on a separate
line in the exported text field. However, this makes it difficult to
sort or to use when comparing two different export files. In order to
overcome this, should you need to, you may specify a delimiter to be
used to separate the multiple lines when exporting them. If you are
going to import the file into Password Safe at a later date and still
have a delimiter character, then it must be specified on the import or
all the Notes lines will appear as one single line in the resulting
database.</p>

<p>If a Notes field multi-line delimiter character is required,
enter it here so that, during the Export process, multiple lines in
Notes field will be exported as a single line using this character
between each of the original lines.</p>

<ol>

  <li>If required, tick that you want to put all separate lines
in the Notes field onto one line and enter the character to be used as
the delimiter. Since the whole Notes field is enclosed between double
quotation marks, this character is prohibited from being selected as
the multi-line delimiter.</li>

  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
