Introduction:
=============
Password Safe is a password database utility. Like many other such
products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an
encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "safe
combination"), instead of all the username/password combinations that
you use.

What makes Password Safe different? Three things:
1. Simplicity: Password Safe is designed to do one thing, and to do it
well. Start the application, enter your "combination", double-click on
the right entry - presto - the password is now on your clipboard,
ready for pasting.
2. Security: The original version was designed by Bruce Schneier -
'nuff said.
3. Open Source: The source code for the project is available for
inspection. For more information, see https://pwsafe.org.

The current version of Password Safe currently runs on Windows XP and
later. Older versions are still available supporting Windows 95, 98,
ME, NT, 2000, as well as PocketPC. Support for additional platforms 
is planned for future releases. 

Downloading:
============
The latest & greatest version of Password Safe may be downloaded from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/passwordsafe/files/latest/download

Non-English Support:
====================
Thanks to the help of volunteers from all over the world, PasswordSafe
now has built-in support for the following languages:
- Czech
- Chinese
- Danish
- Dutch
- French
- German
- Italian
- Polish
- Russian
- Spanish

If you are interested  in making Password Safe available in other
languages, please let me (https://pwsafe.org/contact.php) know.

Installation:
=============
For convenience, Password Safe is packaged into an executable
installer program. This installs the program, sets up shortcuts and
allows you to uninstall the program from the Windows Control
Panel. However, if you prefer, the -bin.zip file contains all the
files you need. Just extract the files (using WinZip, for example) to
any directory, double-click on the Pwsafe.exe icon,and that's
it. You may want to create a shortcut to your desktop and/or Start
menu. Finally, a Microsoft installer (.msi) package is also
available.

========
Password Safe is available under the restrictions set forth in the
standard "Artistic License 2.0". For more details, see the LICENSE
