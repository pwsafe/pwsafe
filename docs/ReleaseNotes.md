Bugs fixed in 3.63.0
--------------------
* [GH966](https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/issues/966) Default font sizes for hi-res displays corrected (Windows).
* [SF1572](https://sourceforge.net/p/passwordsafe/bugs/1572/) [GH959](https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/issues/959) Opening via system tray icon now focuses correctly on Windows 11.
