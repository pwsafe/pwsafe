the Edit menu. Ctrl+F still works as before to show the Find toolbar or transfer

Changes to Existing Features in 3.40
====================================
[] Save Immediately has been enhanced to apply to all changes to the database
and not just after an edit or addition of an entry. It is STRONGLY recommended
that, if enabled, then the option to "Create intermediate backups" is also
enabled. Note, changes made via the Compare database results dialog will not
cause a database save for each action but will after the compare results dialog
has been closed.
[] The last sort direction in List View (ascending or descending) on closing
a database is now stored in the application configuration file and is no longer
stored in the database header.
[] The number of groups shown in the database properties dialog is now counted

[] Disable switch to read-only when unlocking with changes pending.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.39
====================================

group value is deleted. This is similar to the action of the filesystem when
the last file within a folder/directory is deleted.
[463] Double click on a word in the Notes field, e.g. for copy & paste,
now no longer includes any trailing spaces.  This is different to the
standard Microsoft processing in their products.

caption. The Tooltip on how to unprotect an entry is now shown against the
tutorial text at the top of the dialog.

Bugs fixed in 3.38
==================

copied to clipboard whenever generated (no longer copied by default).
