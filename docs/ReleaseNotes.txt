to aid identification. In addition, the System Tray icon tooltip has been enhanced

and not just after an edit or addition of an entry. It is STRONGLY recommended
that, if enabled, then the option to "Create intermediate backups" is also
enabled. Note, changes made via the Compare database results dialog will not
cause a database save for each action but will after the compare results dialog
has been closed.
[] The last sort direction in List View (ascending or descending) on closing
a database is now stored in the application configuration file and is no longer
stored in the database header.

now no longer includes any trailing spaces.  This is different to the
