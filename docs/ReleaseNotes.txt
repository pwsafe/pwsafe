releases may be found in the file ChangeLog.txt.

Bugs fixed in 3.40
==================
[] Correctly import empty groups from a XML file when an imported group has
been specified.
[] Empty groups are now added when merging one PasswordSafe database into another.
[] List view column widths are no longer reset when dragging columns to different
positions or columns are added or removed.
[] The user specified Notes font is now also applied to the Notes column in the
List view.
[] Entry Protected state and AutoType string is now correctly displayed in the
List view.
[] After entry has been edited from List View, it now remains visible after
Edit/Undo/Redo even if the change alters its position within the view.
[1360] When an entry/group using a Named Password Policy is exported to a
PasswordSafe database, the referenced policy is now also exported.
[1355] Fixed tabbing order in Basic AddEdit tab.
[1352] Fixed regression in recent entry processing.
[1347] Prevent a user from trying to copy a filter to a read-only database.
[1346] The Notes window no longer scrolls when re-activated after losing focus. 
[1345] Removed the ability to create a new database when read-only is
checked.
[1342, 1343] Fix multiple empty group issues.
[1335] If "Minimize after Autotype" option is set, it will also be honoured for
the user action: "Browse to URL + Autotype".
[1315] Keep selected entry selected after refreshing the view (F5).
[1314] Selected entries keep highlight when the Find toolbar is opened
and even when Password Safe loses focus to another application.
[1313, 1318] Find toolbar no longer closes when it shouldn't. In addition,
results are updated when entries are added/deleted.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.40
====================================
[] Save Immediately has been enhanced to apply to all changes to the database
and not just after an edit or addition of an entry. It is STRONGLY recommended
that, if enabled, then the option to "Create intermediate backups" is also
enabled. Note, changes made via the Compare database results dialog will not
cause a database save for each action but will after the compare results dialog
has been closed.
[] The last sort direction in List View (ascending or descending) on closing
a database is now stored in the application configuration file and is no longer
stored in the database header.
[] The number of groups shown in the database properties dialog is now counted
in the same manner as directories/folders in a file system, e.g.,
Windows Explorer. This includes empty groups. The number of empty
groups is also shown.

New Features for 3.40
=====================
[] Empty sub-groups are included when exporting a group to a new PasswordSafe
database.
[] Adding an empty group will also cause the database to be saved if the user has
selected the option "Save immediately on Add or Edit".
[811] The user's selected Notes font is now used for Tooltips in the Tree and List
views if the Display preference 'Show Notes as Tooltips in Tree & List views' is
set.
[810] Allow font selection for all the user input fields in the Add/Edit entry
and the Create Shortcut dialogs.

Bugs fixed in 3.39.1
====================
[] Fixed a regression that crept into 3.39, breaking non-English
language support.

Bugs fixed in 3.39
==================
[1334] An empty group is now correctly changed to a normal group when
an entry is copied into it via Drag & Drop.
[1330] Duplication of an alias or shortcut base entry now correctly
results in a normal entry.
[1319] Re-implement fix for BR 1319 so that the added entry no longer 
appears always selected until the display is refreshed.
[] Export of a complete database to XML now includes all Named Password
Policies.
[] When renaming a group, all empty subgroups are now correctly renamed.
[] Disable switch to read-only when unlocking with changes pending.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.39
====================================
[806] The group will be saved as an "empty group" when the last entry with this
group value is deleted. This is similar to the action of the filesystem when
the last file within a folder/directory is deleted.
[463] Double click on a word in the Notes field, e.g. for copy & paste,
now no longer includes any trailing spaces.  This is different to the
standard Microsoft processing in their products.

New Features for 3.39
=====================
[] Support Drag & Drop of empty groups and groups containing empty
groups between multiple instances of PasswordSafe.  Note: Prior versions
of PasswordSafe will not recognise or process empty groups.

the Manage Password Policies dialog (right click on the name).

Bugs fixed in 3.38.2
====================

entry was being edited (and possibly other scenarios).

against the tutorial text at the top of the dialog for wide displays.

tutorial text at the top of the dialog.
