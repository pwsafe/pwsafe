Password Safe 3.37 Release Notes - September 2015
=================================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with the latest versions of Password Safe. For a short description of
Password Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more 
information on the product and the project, please visit
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net. Details about changes to older
releases may be found in the file ChangeLog.txt.

New Features for 3.37
=====================
[] The Notes External Editor now accepts environment strings (e.g. %windir%)
in the path to the editor.
[789] If the double-click action (or shift-double-click) of an entry
is set to Edit/View Entry, then (shift-) double-clicking on its
shortcut will edit/view the base entry. The selected shortcut entry
can still be viewed/edited via menu, right-click or just hitting Enter.
[782] Notes field font is now user-configurable.
[781] Virtual Keyboard - allow playing sound when a valid or invalid key
is pressed and add caption to the Space Bar (Partial implementation of
this Feature Request).

Bugs fixed in 3.37
==================
[1274] References to base entries are now scrollable, no longer
truncated.
[1273] Find in the Tree View will now ensure that any found entry will be
visible by scrolling appropriately.
[1272] XML export of single entry using default Password policy now
works correctly.
[1270] Display Filter dropdown list of filter fields now fits on low
resolution screens.
[1269] Filters containing Password Policy Names now export/import
correctly to/from XML.
[1267] Export from a YubiKey-protected database to another database
fixed.
[1261] 'Unlock Difficulty' slider is now correctly initialised in the Manage
Options Security tab.
[1260] If Password Safe is unable to find the user specified external editor,
the external edit is cancelled and the Notes field remains unchanged.
[1254] Toolbar customisation now has correctly aligned text/images.
[1244] Changes to symbol set in default password policy are respected
when "Use easy-to-read characters" is set.
[1230] "Open as read-only" check-box correctly set when opening a R/W database
after previously opening/selecting a R-O database.
[1124] Autotype on a shortcut entry now picks up title, group and user
fields from shortcut instead of base.
[1082] Field modification times set to creation time for list view and
entry's time and date tab. This is more useful than "N/A", e.g., for
sorting by password modification to find old passwords that should be
changed.

PasswordSafe file.

[1212] In the Flattened List view, keep the icon column, if present,
as leftmost, to ensure proper display.
[1211] The Read-Only checkbox no longer clears itself after returning
from the file selection dialog. Also, the read-only checkbox in XP
file selection dialog is handled correctly.
[1210] CurrentFile preference is updated sooner rather than later, so
last database is set as default for next invocation.
