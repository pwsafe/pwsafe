See the online Help (the XML section of "Import Password Entries") if you
need to manually convert old XML files.
[] After closing the current database, on opening another, PasswordSafe will first
attempt to access the directory of the last opened database in order to allow the user

PasswordSafe will open the default "My Safes" directory as it did prior to this change.

via a menu item or by double-clicking on the current R-O or R/W
indicator in the Status Bar.

V1 and KeePass V2 XML files. Note that KeePass V2's export in the V1
format is does not conform to their own format as specified by their

the settings in KeePass required during their export.

[] Polish installation texts added thanks to Michal Niklas.
[] An entry's password expiry date is set or cleared directly rather than using
the Set and Clear buttons after changing values.
[] The default password generation policy is now for 12 character
passwords that include symbol characters (previous default was 8, no
symbols).
[] Unknown database header fields and unknown entry fields are no
longer exported when a database is exported to XML as there is no
mechanism to re-check them during import. Exporting to XML and then
importing to a new database can be used to remove these unknown
fields.
[] Date time fields, when exported to XML, now are in the W3C dateTime
standard format instead of PasswordSafe's.  This release can import
XML files with date time fields in either of these forms. The next
release will only be able to process the W3C standard.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25
====================================
[3171962] The password expiration warning mechanism now checks for
expiration daily. The display of expired and almost-expired entries
has been redesigned, allowing users to update the entry directly. When
an expired password is changed, the expiry date will be cleared unless
there is a recurring password expiry interval, in which case a new
expiry date will be calculated.
[3131945] Double-clicking on the system tray icon when PasswordSafe is
not minimized now brings it to front, instead of minimizing.

[3194472] Fix new group creation location. When a Group is selected, then
selecting 'Add Group' from the Edit menu or from the context menu
displayed by right clicking on that Group, the new group will be a
child of the selected group. However, when using the context menu
displayed on right clicking on 'white space' below the last
entry/group displayed, the group will be created at the topmost
level. 
[3165889] No longer crashes if search starts with Shift-Enter (search

the entry).
[2832810] A new email field has been added, supporting email headers
'to', 'subject', 'cc', 'bcc' and 'body' (per RFC 2368 - see online
help for details). If this field is not empty, it is used instead of
the URL field even if that contains an email address.
Note: whereas the URL field had to have the 'mailto:' prefix to denote an 
email address rather than a URL, the email field must not contain this prefix.
[] PasswordSafe now handles Vista (and later) logoff, shutdown &
restart more gracefully, giving the user now has more time to save a
modified database.
[] Add new AutoType special fields '\wnnn' and '\Wnnn'. Unlike '\d', which

introduces a one-time delay where they appear.  For '\w', the value 'nnn' is in

using a French keyboard.
[] If a dialog is open (e.g. Add, Edit, Options etc.) and Password Safe is

[] If preferences stored in the database are changed, the user will be asked if
they want to save them in the database when closing the database or application
even if none of the entries have been changed.
[] The preference to Lock the Database after a certain amount of idle time has
changed from being a global parameter affecting all databases opened by the user
to be specific to each database.

New Features for 2.0:
=====================
Two major new features in this release: A new database format, and a
new tree view. The former should be invisible to users, the latter
quite useful.

The application imports old database files transparently, and warns
the user upon saving that the new format is incompatible with old
versions of the program.

Also, the first URL in the Notes field (starting with http: or https:)
will be added to the popup (right-click) menu for that entry. 
Selecting it will invoke the default browser on that URL.

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim 
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me (https://sourceforge.net/users/ronys) know.

Finally, the graphics have been spruced up a bit - thanks to Emilijan
Mirceski for his patient work on the new logo and toolbar!
