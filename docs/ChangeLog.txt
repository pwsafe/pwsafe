the database is in R-O mode or the entry is protected.
[] Filter image in Status bar is no longer replaced by 'Filter1' after
changing preferences via Manage->Options.
[] Selecting hexadecimal passwords as the database policy no longer
causes validation to fail.
[] Correctly show database has been modified (to allow saving) if
database preferences have been changed.

New Features for 3.26
=====================
[3288341] Autotype has been added to the DragBar. Drag the image to an
input area on another Window (e.g., Browser) and PasswordSafe will
begin Autotype from there. 
[3286721] User can now toggle between read-only and read-write modes
via a menu item or by double-clicking on the current R-O or R/W
indicator in the Status Bar.
[3203152] The displayed language can now be changed via the new
Manage->Change Language menu.

current database's default Autotype string (if set via Manage->Options).
[2964804, 1855389] The user can specify the list of symbols valid for
password generation, and can override this for any particular
entry (except when EasyVision or Pronounceable passwords are chosen).
[1831893, 1471134] Added Autotype code "\s" to send "Shift+Tab" (back tab).
[] Allow user to control copying of the password to clipboard when
performing "Browse to URL" via an option in Options->Security. This is
a database option i.e., you can have different setting for different
databases.
[] Support importing of TXT, CSV files and XML exported from KeePass
V1 and KeePass V2 XML files. Note that KeePass V2's export in the V1
format is does not conform to their own format as specified by their
V1 product and can not be imported. Please review our Help file for

Changes to Existing Features in 3.26
====================================
[] New image on start-up dialog - courtesy of user Prinz_Eugen.
[] Polish installation texts added thanks to Michal Niklas.

[] The default password generation policy is now for 12 character
passwords that include symbol characters (previous default was 8, no
symbols).
[] Unknown database header fields and unknown entry fields are no
longer exported when a database is exported to XML as there is no
mechanism to re-check them during import. Exporting to XML and then
importing to a new database can be used to remove these unknown
fields.
[] Date time fields, when exported to XML, now are in the W3C dateTime
standard format instead of PasswordSafe's.  This release can import
XML files with date time fields in either of these forms. The next
release will only be able to process the W3C standard.

exported, imported and displayed in the Manage Filters dialog.
[3301904] Export XML, export Text and the export of filters functions

neeeded.

"-s <databasename>".
[3088187] The correct entry in List View is now used for Autotype when

displaying entries with passwords that are expired or about to expire.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25
====================================
[3171962] The password expiration warning mechanism now checks for
expiration daily. The display of expired and almost-expired entries
has been redesigned, allowing users to update the entry directly. When
an expired password is changed, the expiry date will be cleared unless
there is a recurring password expiry interval, in which case a new
expiry date will be calculated.
[3131945] Double-clicking on the system tray icon when PasswordSafe is
not minimized now brings it to front, instead of minimizing.

performed via the Rename shortcut (default value F2), using the Edit
menu or the right-click context menu. Edit in place by double clicking
the entry is no longer allowed as, most of the time, this was not the
desired action.

thanks to pm_kan.
[] pm_kan has updated the Russian texts.

Bugs fixed in 3.25
==================
[3194472] Fix new group creation location. When a Group is selected, then
selecting 'Add Group' from the Edit menu or from the context menu
displayed by right clicking on that Group, the new group will be a
child of the selected group. However, when using the context menu
displayed on right clicking on 'white space' below the last
entry/group displayed, the group will be created at the topmost
level. 
[3165889] No longer crashes if search starts with Shift-Enter (search
backwards).

"Show Desktop" feature.
[] No longer crashes when doing an Undo after a Merge.
[] Ensure Undo/Redo honour the changes to the display of the original change.

New Features for 3.24.1
=======================
[] Allow an entry to be protected against modification even if the database
is opened in read-write mode. See 'Basic Tab' in Edit dialog. In Tree mode,
a number sign (#) after the name indicates the entry is protected. In
List mode, the 'Protected' column may be added to the list. A
protected entry can not be edited, renamed or deleted and retains this
property if Dragged & Dropped onto another database.

[3065107] Confirm Delete dialog for an entry now shows the entry's details.
[3062854] Advanced Dialog Options settings are saved for a session to allow
re-use. The following functions use the this dialog and their settings are saved

the use of the System Tray and a valid Hot Key, then the System Tray
icon and the button on the Taskbar can be hidden.
[3017535] Allow user to edit the generated passwords (Manage->Generate Password)
before copying to the clipboard.

successfully found the first time.
[] Undo/Redo of changes to the currently open database. Any change to
the database can now be undone and redone, as long as the database is
open. This is similar to the undo/redo feature available in most word
processors, and is activated the same way (Ctrl-Z for undo, Ctrl-Y for
redo, or via the Edit menu).
[] New Synchronize feature (subset of the current Merge function) to
allow changes in the fields of entries of two databases to be
synchronised.  Entries with identical Group names, Titles and User

opened in read-only mode.

the entry).
[2832810] A new email field has been added, supporting email headers
'to', 'subject', 'cc', 'bcc' and 'body' (per RFC 2368 - see online
help for details). If this field is not empty, it is used instead of
the URL field even if that contains an email address.
Note: whereas the URL field had to have the 'mailto:' prefix to denote an 
email address rather than a URL, the email field must not contain this prefix.
[] PasswordSafe now handles Vista (and later) logoff, shutdown &
restart more gracefully, giving the user now has more time to save a
modified database.
[] Add new AutoType special fields '\wnnn' and '\Wnnn'. Unlike '\d', which
sets the delay between sending each subsequent character, '\w' & '\W'
introduces a one-time delay where they appear.  For '\w', the value 'nnn' is in
milli-seconds. For '\W', this specifies seconds. Note: Max. value is
999s (16m 39s), during which time PasswordSafe will be unresponsive
while it waits the specified time. Also supported via the Run Command
$a command.

the shortcut for "Password Subset" has been changed from "Ctrl + -" to
"Ctrl + B". Please do not allocate "Ctrl + -" to any shortcut if you will be
using a French keyboard.
[] If a dialog is open (e.g. Add, Edit, Options etc.) and Password Safe is
minimized, the Close and Exit options are no longer in the System Tray context
menu. The user must first Restore the application and close the dialog before
being able to close the database or exit the program.
[] If preferences stored in the database are changed, the user will be asked if
they want to save them in the database when closing the database or application
even if none of the entries have been changed.
[] The preference to Lock the Database after a certain amount of idle time has
changed from being a global parameter affecting all databases opened by the user
to be specific to each database.

the user upon saving that the new format is incompatible with old
versions of the program.

Also, the first URL in the Notes field (starting with http: or https:)
will be added to the popup (right-click) menu for that entry. 
Selecting it will invoke the default browser on that URL.

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim 
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me (https://sourceforge.net/users/ronys) know.

Mirceski for his patient work on the new logo and toolbar!
