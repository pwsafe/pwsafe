Changes to Existing Features in 3.40
====================================
[] Save Immediately has been enhanced to apply to all changes to the database
and not just after an edit or addition of an entry. It is STRONGLY recommended
that, if enabled, then the option to "Create intermediate backups" is also
enabled. Note, changes made via the Compare database results dialog will not
cause a database save for each action but will after the compare results dialog
has been closed.
[] The last sort direction in List View (ascending or descending) on closing
a database is now stored in the application configuration file and is no longer
stored in the database header.
[] The number of groups shown in the database properties dialog is now counted
in the same manner as directories/folders in a file system, e.g.,
Windows Explorer. This includes empty groups. The number of empty
groups is also shown.

New Features for 3.40
=====================
[] Empty sub-groups are included when exporting a group to a new PasswordSafe
database.
[] Adding an empty group will also cause the database to be saved if the user has
selected the option "Save immediately on Add or Edit".
[811] The user's selected Notes font is now used for Tooltips in the Tree and List
views if the Display preference 'Show Notes as Tooltips in Tree & List views' is

[] Disable switch to read-only when unlocking with changes pending.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.39
====================================
[806] The group will be saved as an "empty group" when the last entry with this
group value is deleted. This is similar to the action of the filesystem when
the last file within a folder/directory is deleted.

now no longer includes any trailing spaces.  This is different to the
standard Microsoft processing in their products.

groups between multiple instances of PasswordSafe.  Note: Prior versions
of PasswordSafe will not recognise or process empty groups.

the Manage Password Policies dialog (right click on the name).

now no longer includes any trailing spaces.  This is different to the

tutorial text at the top of the dialog.

Bugs fixed in 3.38
==================
[1289] Uniform behavior for generated password: Can be explicitly
copied to clipboard whenever generated (no longer copied by default).
[1266] Toolbar elements display correctly on high-resolution monitors
under Windows 8.1 and later.

last database is set as default for next invocation.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.35
====================================

See the online Help (the XML section of "Import Password Entries") if you
need to manually convert old XML files.
[] After closing the current database, on opening another, PasswordSafe will first
attempt to access the directory of the last opened database in order to allow the user

PasswordSafe will open the default "My Safes" directory as it did prior to this change.

database preferences have been changed.

New Features for 3.26

input area on another Window (e.g., Browser) and PasswordSafe will
begin Autotype from there.

databases.
[] Support importing of TXT, CSV files and XML exported from KeePass
V1 and KeePass V2 XML files. Note that KeePass V2's export in the V1
format is does not conform to their own format as specified by their

the settings in KeePass required during their export. 

Changes to Existing Features in 3.26
====================================
[] New image on start-up dialog - courtesy of user Prinz_Eugen.
[] Polish installation texts added thanks to Michal Niklas.
[] An entry's password expiry date is set or cleared directly rather than using
the Set and Clear buttons after changing values.
[] The default password generation policy is now for 12 character
passwords that include symbol characters (previous default was 8, no
symbols).
[] Unknown database header fields and unknown entry fields are no
longer exported when a database is exported to XML as there is no
mechanism to re-check them during import. Exporting to XML and then
importing to a new database can be used to remove these unknown
fields.
[] Date time fields, when exported to XML, now are in the W3C dateTime
standard format instead of PasswordSafe's.  This release can import
XML files with date time fields in either of these forms. The next
release will only be able to process the W3C standard.

[3088187] The correct entry in List View is now used for Autotype when
using the keyboard to select the entry when PasswordSafe first opens.

policy 'symbols' fields of entries.

New Features for 3.25

and Fred.
[] Korean texts in the application and installer program thanks to
Seunggyun.
[] Poserpro has provided Traditional Chinese texts for the installer
program.

displaying entries with passwords that are expired or about to expire.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25
====================================
[3171962] The password expiration warning mechanism now checks for
expiration daily. The display of expired and almost-expired entries
has been redesigned, allowing users to update the entry directly. When
an expired password is changed, the expiry date will be cleared unless
there is a recurring password expiry interval, in which case a new
expiry date will be calculated.

restart more gracefully, giving the user now has more time to save a
modified database.

they want to save them in the database when closing the database or application
even if none of the entries have been changed.

changed from being a global parameter affecting all databases opened by the user
to be specific to each database.

New Features for 2.0:

the user upon saving that the new format is incompatible with old
versions of the program.

Also, the first URL in the Notes field (starting with http: or https:)
will be added to the popup (right-click) menu for that entry. 
Selecting it will invoke the default browser on that URL.

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim 
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me  know.

Finally, the graphics have been spruced up a bit - thanks to Emilijan
Mirceski for his patient work on the new logo and toolbar!
