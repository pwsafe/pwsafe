<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>There are several 'degrees of freedom' for Windows developers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Development tools: Microsoft's Visual Studio <i>2013</i>
(referred to as 'VS2013' below) is currently the main development
environment, and pwsafe-12.sln is the main toplevel "solution" file (the <em>12</em> refers to the version of the C++ compiler). Visual Studio <i>2012</i>
(referred to as 'VS2012' below) is also still maintained. Its solution and project files have a suffix of "-11" corresponding
to the version of the C++ compiler (VC11).
</li>
<li>pwsafe_wx-12.sln is used to build the wxWidgets version under Windows, although this version is not
formally supported under Windows (but see the <a href="#visExp">note</a> re: Visual Express below).  Note:
the wxWidgets library must be built with the same version of Visual Studio as being used to build
PasswordSafe or you will receive numerous compatibility error messages during the link phase.</li>
<li>Previous versions i.e. Visual Studio 2005 (MSVS8) and 2010 (MSVS10) are no longer maintained but their
solution and project files have been retained in the "old-sln" directory.
See <a href="#visExp">note</a> below for Visual Express users.</li>
<li>User interface library: The currently supported version of PasswordSafe for Windows
is built upon MFC (Microsoft's Foundation Classes). The wxWidgets version, which provides cross
platform support can also be built on Windows and corresponds to that used on other platforms i.e.
Linux and MAC OS.  Note that the wxWidgets version in all environments does not support all features
supported by the Windows MFC version, for example, different alphabet virtual keyboards.  If you
depend on such features, you should stick to the standard MFC build.</li>
<li>XML support: As PasswordSafe provides XML import/export capabilities, it
can be configured to use one of several XML parsers (or none).
The currently supported version of PasswordSafe for Windows is built using the
Microsoft XML parser. </li>
</ol>

<p>Note regarding Visual Express: The MFC version of PasswordSafe
<span style="font-weight: bold;">cannot</span> be built using Visual Express,
as Microsoft does not provide MFC support in this product. It should, however,
be possible to build the wxWidgets version.</p>

<p>To summarise: The 'official' version of PasswordSafe on Windows
platforms is based on MFC (Microsoft's Foundation Classes), and
uses Microsoft's XML parser. This corresponds to the <i>ReleaseM</i>
configuration in the build environment, i.e., the release build using Microsoft's
XML parser.  This will build the required DLLs using their Release configuration
(pws_at.dll for AutoType support and pws_osk.dll for the Virtual Keyboard) and
the base resource DLL (pwsafe_base.dll used to create non-English language support).</p>

<p>The Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 projects have been updated to be able to generate the 64-bit
versions of both the MFC and wxWidgets. <b>This has only been tested on a 64-bit Windows
environment with the VC10 64-bit compiler.  It has not been tested on a 32-bit Windows
environment with a cross-compiler.</b> For wxWidgets, you will need the 64-bit static
libraries and they should be placed in a new directory 'lib64\vc_lib' corresponding to
the current 'lib\vc_lib' for the 32-bit versions.  <i>If you continue to use VS2005,
you should put the static libraries built by it in '\lib\vc8_lib'.</i></p>

<p>For each Configuration there is an associated platform. Unfortunately, Visual Studio
adds all defined platforms to all defined configurations even if a particular combination
is not valid. The supported combinations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Configuration name <i>does not</i> end with '64', only platform "Win32" is supported.</li>
<li>If the Configuration name <i>does</i> end with '64', only platform "x64" is supported.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>No other combinations are supported or have been tested.</i></b>

<p>The current MFC configurations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>32-bit versions - platform Win32:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Debug</b> - builds the debug version of the required DLLs (pws_at_D.dll and pws_osk_D.dll).
This project is automatically selected when any of the debug builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>DebugM</b> - builds the debug version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugX</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Release</b> - builds the release version of the required DLLs (pws_at.dll and pws_osk.dll)
and the resource DLL (pwsafe_base.dll). This project is automatically selected when any 
of the release builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>ReleaseM</b> - builds the release version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleaseX</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>

<li>64-bit versions - platform x64:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Debug64</b> - builds the debug version of the required DLLs (pws_at_D.dll and pws_osk_D.dll).
This project is automatically selected when any of the debug builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>DebugM64</b> - builds the debug version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugX64</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Release64</b> - builds the release version of the required DLLs (pws_at.dll and pws_osk.dll)
and the resource DLL (pwsafe_base.dll). This project is automatically selected when any 
of the release builds below are selected.</li>
<li><b>ReleaseM64</b> - builds the release version using the Microsoft XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleaseX64</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The current wxWidgets configurations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>32-bit versions - platform Win32:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Debugwx</b> - builds the debug version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugwxX</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Releasewx</b> - builds the release version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleasewxX</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>

<li>64-bit versions - platform x64:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Debugwx64</b> - builds the debug version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>DebugwxX64</b> - builds the debug version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
<li><b>Releasewx64</b> - builds the release version without any XML parser</li>
<li><b>ReleasewxX64</b> - builds the release version using the Xerces XML parser</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Note that the core and os project files contain <i>all</i> of the above projects,
even if you are only selecting one of the MFC or the wxWidget builds. You should not
have to select them individually as selecting the main PasswordSafe 
configuration will select the correct configuration for these projects. <i>You should
also be careful not to select all configurations in the Visual Studio Batch Build process
either to build, rebuild or clean all configurations. Only select MFC configurations
if using the MFC PasswordSafe solution (pwsafe-12.sln) and the wxWidgets
configurations if using the wxWidgets PasswordSafe solution (pwsafe_wx-12.sln).</i></p>

General Settings panel).</p>

<h4><a name="Windows_Build"></a>Windows Build</h4>

<p>The Windows version of PasswordSafe can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio
2013 (C++ compiler for PaswordSafe ('VC12') and C# compiler if you wish to re-generate
the Virtual Keyboard data, which is not normally necessary). The Visual Studio Express compiler
does <u>not</u> support Microsoft's Foundation Classes, which are used extensively
within the current official Windows version. Visual Studio 2012 / VC11 is also supported, although no longer the main development environment.</p>

<p>The main (toplevel) Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 solution file is pwsafe-12.sln.</p>

<p>In order to build the Windows version of PasswordSafe, you
need to install the following freely available components, in addition to
Visual Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd146047.aspx">
Microsoft's Windows SDK</a>.
If using Visual Studio 2012, you should use the Windows SDK version
V7.1A. For VS2013, you should use version V8.1A. For no longer maintained versions
please refer to <a href="#No_longer_maintained_VS">
No Longer Maintained Visual Studio Development Environments (Windows only)</a> below.
</li>
<li>To compile and produce the Help files (.chm) then
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-%0D%0Ac8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&amp;DisplayLang=en">
Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop</a> is required. Note however that the headers and
libraries necessary for compiling PasswordSafe itself are included in the
Windows SDK mentioned above.</li>
<li>A git client, such as <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download">
Tortoise git Client</a> (for updating the revision number within PasswordSafe's
version details)</li>
<li>For XML Support, one or more of the following is needed (see the
<a href="#XML_Processing"> XML processing section</a> for more details):
<ul>
<li>Headers and libraries to support Microsoft's XML V6.0 are included in
the Windows SDK mentioned above and do not need to be installed separately.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces
V3.1.1 XML Library</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> For unit testing, Google's <a target="_blank"
  href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest">gtest</a>
  library is used. This is only used to build the src/test project,
  which may be disabled if desired.
</ul>

<p><b>SDK & WDK NOTE:</b> In order to compile PasswordSafe using MFC,
the Microsoft Windows SDK's 'include' and 'lib' directories
must be added to the directories supplied by Visual Studio.
In addition, since the implementation of support for the YubiKey
hardware, the Windows Driver Kit must also be installed and its
libraries made available to Visual Studio. For VS2012, WDK 7.1A is
required and, for VS2013, WDK V8.1A. Note due to an incompatibility
between WDK 7.1A and SDK 7.1 for VS2012, an include file must be deleted
from the installed WDK V7.1A (see the Readme.txt file in the
src/os/windows/yubi directory for more details). This is <u>not</u>
required if using VS2013 and WDK 8.1.
</b></p>

<p><b>Compiling using Visual Studio:</b> If you're using Microsoft's Visual
Studio, the file "UserVariables-12.props" for VS2013, or "UserVariables-15.props"
for VS2015 <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> exist and describe the directories where
the non-"Windows SDK" components have been installed. <b><u><i>The solution
will not open correctly without this file being present</i></u></b>.
For your convenience, we've included simple Visual Basic scripts, "configure-12.vbs" and "configure-14.vbs" for VS2013 ans VS2015, respectively,
 in the src/ui/Windows directory (src/ui/wxWidgets directory for the wxWidgets builds), that you can
run to generate the above file with the correct values. These script will also
prompt for the location of the 64-bit Xerces libraries for 64-bit builds.
<b>When migrating from VS2013 to VS2015, ensure that you run the configure-14.vbs
in order to add the location of the Windows Driver Kit for a successful build of
the YubiKey library.</b></p>

<h3><a name="XML_Processing"></a>XML Processing</h3>

<p>Originally, PasswordSafe used Microsoft's XML library for XML parsing and
validation. For portability, we're now support the
<a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/" target="_blank">Xerces</a> XML
libraries, which are available for non-Windows platforms. We recommend the
latest version (currently 3.1.3 as of April 2016).  For VS2015 (VC14), you will
need to copy and modify the directory ..\xerces-c-3.1.3\projects\Win32\VC12 to
..\xerces-c-3.1.3\projects\Win32\VC14 and open the solution file xerces-all.sln in
subdirectory xerces-all and let VS2015 convert the project.  You only need to build
the project "Static Debug" and/or "Static Release" configurations of project XercesLib.
<b>Note: for 64-bit Xerces builds, you must use the 64-bit versions of the Xerces libraries.</b></p>

<p><b>It is important that you have the Xerces libraries built with the same version
of Visual Studio as you are using to build PasswordSafe.  You will receive numerous
error messages during the link stage if they are not the same.  The same applies to the
wxWidgest library if building that version of PasswordSafe under Windows.</b></p>

<p>To determine which XML library to use while building PasswordSafe,
we've defined a pre-processor variable (USE_XML_LIBRARY). If <u>NOT</u>
defined, the compiled PasswordSafe <u>will not process XML files</u>
(databases or filter definitions in XML format). Filters within a database
will be treated as 'Unknown Fields' and will remain unchanged so that
other versions of PasswordSafe that do support XML parsing can still
use them. Note, however, that the application will be able to write XML files.</p>

<p>The two valid values of the USE_XML_LIBRARY variable are
"MSXML" and "XERCES" corresponding to the three different implementations.
For wxWidgets builds, only XERCES will be possible but they are
still under development (as of August 2010).</p>

<p>PasswordSafe uses SAX2 processing for both Microsoft's and the Xerces' XML
Parsers, which are full validating parsers and require the presence of
the appropriate XSD Schema file (included in the distribution and in the
"xml" sub-directory, to process either file or filter imports. This
ensures that the data eventually hitting the SAX2 content handlers is
correct and just needs placing in the appropriate fields.</p>

<h3><a name="Gtest"></a> Gtest framework</h3>

<p>The following instructions were written for version 1.7.0 of gtest.</p>

<p>PasswordSafe uses the <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest" target="_blank">gtest</a>
framework in the DebugM build - specifically the DebugM build of the coretest project.</p>

<p>To generate the required library, open gtest.sln in the "msvc" sub-directory in the gtest
directory.</p>
<p>You only need to build the Debug version of gtest library (gtestd.lib) in the gtest project of the
solution "gtest.sln". <b>However</b>, if you use the CMake process, it does require the "gtest_maind.lib"
library <b>and</b> their Release equivalents.  In this case, it is probably easier to right-click on the
gtest_main project and build both configurations since this project builds both libraries.</p>

<p>PasswordSafe does not use the "gtest-md.sln" solution nor following projects
in gtest.sln:</p>
<ol type="a">
 <li>gtest_main (except if you use CMake as above)</li>
 <li>gtest_prod_test</li>
 <li>gtest_unittest</li>
</ol> 
<p>The following changes should be made to the (converted) project file:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Configuration Properties: General: (where NN is 12 for VS2013 &amp; 14 for VS2015)
    <ul>
      <li> All configurations:<br>
          Output directory:       ..\build-vcNN/$(Configuration)\<br>
          Intermediate Directory: $(Configuration)/$(ProjectName)\
      </li>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
         Target Name:            $(ProjectName)d
      </li>
      <li>Release configuration (not used by PasswordSafe):<br>
         Target Name:            $(ProjectName)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Configuration Properties: C/C++: General
    <ul>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
          Debug Information Format: Program Database (/Zi)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li>Configuration Properties: C/C++: Output Files
    <ul>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
          Program Database File Name: $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName)d.pdb
      </li>
      <li>Release configuration (not used by PasswordSafe):<br>
          Program Database File Name: $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).pdb
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish to build the 64-bit version, you will first have to create a new
platform x64 and then make similar changes as above.  Note: When creating the new
platform via the Configuration Manager, it is easier to select copy from the
current x86 platform and then just make the changes marked in bold below but
do not forget to add WIN64 to the C preprocessor definitions for the x64 platform:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Configuration Properties: General: (where NN is 12 for VS2013 &amp; 14 for VS2015)
    <ul>
      <li> All configurations:<br>
          Output directory:       ..\build-vcNN/$(Configuration)<b>64</b>\<br>
          Intermediate Directory: $(Configuration)/$(ProjectName)<b>64</b>\
      </li>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
         Target Name:            $(ProjectName)d
      </li>
      <li>Release configuration (not used by PasswordSafe):<br>
         Target Name:            $(ProjectName)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Configuration Properties: C/C++: General
    <ul>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
          Debug Information Format: Program Database (/Zi)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
  <li>Configuration Properties: C/C++: Output Files
    <ul>
      <li>Debug configuration:<br>
          Program Database File Name: $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName)d.pdb
      </li>
      <li>Release configuration (not used by PasswordSafe):<br>
          Program Database File Name: $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).pdb
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Please remember to (re-)run the PasswordSafe configure-12.vbs or configure-14.vbs script to set
the necessary gtest include and library directories.  These would normally be the subdirectories
"include" and either "build-vc12" or "build-vc14" of the "gtest-1.7.0" directory.</p>

<p>Note: you can also make the similar changes to those above in the projects not used by
PasswordSafe in gtest.sln  if you wish to run the gtest Test programs.</p>

<h3><a name="Minidump_Production"></a>Minidump Production (Windows only)</h3>

<p>In order to help debug user problems when Windows just says "there has
been an error", a "Windows Unhandled Fault Handler" has been added. This will
create a minidump, which can then be used to find where the error took
place and, hopefully, why.</p>

<p>An extra "extended" Command Line flag of "--testdump" has been introduced
for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the developer to test the minidump process,
which is only available in the Release version of the executable and,
secondly, allows the translators to check that the error screen displays
as they wish.</p>

<p><u>Note to Translators:</u> the error screen is a basic Windows function
and has a fixed width. This is the reason why the minidump file name and
directory have been split onto separate lines.</p>

<p><u>Note: Extended flags start with two minus signs ('--') and must be
specified in full - i.e. no abbreviations. They are not displayed in the
Usage notes for the normal users and no error message or display is shown
if they are not recognised.</u></p>

<p>With this flag set, an extra button will appear in the bottom right
hand corner of the "About PasswordSafe" dialog. Click it, and a minidump
should be produced.</p>

<p>In order to process the minidump, either the free Microsoft Windbg
program can be used (see Microsoft's site for details), or Visual Studio
(VS) can be used. In the latter case (and probably the former too!):</p>
<ol>
<li>You need the source corresponding to the failing release
version. This should be available from SourceForge web site either in
the normal Download section or from the Subversion repository, based on
the revision number associated with that release. Without the
corresponding source, VS can only show Windows source and line numbers in
PasswordSafe source. With the corresponding source, VS can show you the
exact line in PasswordSafe where the error took place and also the other
statements within PasswordSafe as you follow the stack trace.</li>
<li>You need the Program Debug Database (pwsafe.pdb) associated with the
failing release. This is not normally uploaded to the SourceForge web
site with the release package. It is large (~11.5MB or ~3MB
compressed). Since this must correspond to the PasswordSafe executable that
had the error, maybe this and, possibly, the associated Link Map can be
uploaded to a Developers section on this web site to aid all developers.</li>
<li>You should probably maintain the directory structure of the project
as described in the source downloaded from SourceForge and place the
Program Debug Database file in the '..\src\bin\releasem' directory.</li>
<li>Save the user's minidump file on your PC. Use VS to Open this <u>as
a Project</u> (e.g. File-&gt;Open-&gt;Project/Solution).</li>
<li>In the Debugging Options, specify the directory containing the corresponding
PDB file. (Go to: Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Debugging-&gt;Symbols and add
this directory in the section entitled "Symbol file (.pdb)
locations:").</li>
<li>Press F5 to start debugging, and away you go.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="No_longer_maintained_VS"></a>No Longer Maintained Visual Studio Development Environments (Windows only)</h3>

<p>If you have installed Visual Studio 2008,
it will have installed a Windows SDK V6.0A and you do not have to install
another SDK. If you haven't installed VS2008, then please select either
of the following versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Windows Vista Update &amp; .NET 3.0 SDK"
[V6.1.6000.16384.10 dated February 2007] - known as V6.0.</li>
<li>"Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5"
[V6.0.6001.18000.367 dated February 2008] - known as V6.1.</li>
<li>"Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
[V6.1.7600.16385 dated August 2009] - known as V7.0.</li>
</ul>
All these replace the old "Platform SDK" and support Operating
Systems: Vista and Windows XP; and Development Environments: Visual
Studio 2005 and 2008. However, V7.0 and later support Windows 7 <b>but not</b>
Visual Studio 2005. At this time, PasswordSafe does not use any facilities or
functions that are not supported by Windows XP and Visual Studio 2005.
<br>
By default, the SDKs are installed in directory "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN", where NNN is '6.0', '6.0A', '6.1' or '7.0'.
<u>See note below.</u>
</ul>

<p><b>SDK NOTE:</b> In order to compile PasswordSafe using MFC,
the Microsoft Windows SDK's 'include' and 'lib' directories
must be added to the directories supplied by Visual Studio. This is
achieved in VS2005 via Tools &gt; Options &gt; Project and Solutions
&gt; VC++ directories &gt; Include files and Library files.
They can be added at the end of each appropriate set using the directory you
specified during installation (the defaults are: "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN\Include" and "C:\Program
Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\NNN\Lib", where NNN is 6.0, 6.0A, 6.1 or 7.0 as
noted above). The Microsoft Visual Studio Registration Tool only adds
the .Net libraries and not those needed for PasswordSafe. It is
recommended that you get SDK V6.1 <u>and</u> you place them above the
libraries supplied with Visual Studio e.g. "$(VCInstallDir)PlatformSDK\include"
and "$(VCInstallDir)PlatformSDK\lib" otherwise you may get warning messages
compiling source members using BlockInput.</p>
