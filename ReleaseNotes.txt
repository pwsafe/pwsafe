Password Safe 2.0 Release Note - February 2004
=================================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with Password Safe version 2.0. For a short description of Password
Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more
information on the product and the project, please visit
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net

This is the first non-beta release of version 2.0 of PasswordSafe. The
first beta was released over two months ago, and while several minor
issues have been found and fixed, there have been *no* reports of lost
or corrupted data. Therefore, I think that 2.0 is ready for prime
time.

Thanks to all the brave souls who've downloaded the pre-2.0 releases,
reported bugs and have patiently explained, duplicated, posted test
data, suggested fixes and workarounds, and verified fixes. Without
you, this release would not have been possible!

New Features for 2.0:
=====================
Two major new features in this release: A new database format, and a
new tree view. The former should be invisible to users, the latter
quite useful.

The application imports old database files transparently, and warns
the user upon saving that the new format is incompatible with old
versions of the program.

Also, the first URL in the Notes field (starting with http: or https:)
will be added to the popup (right-click) menu for that entry. 
Selecting it will invoke the default browser on that URL.

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim 
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me (https://sourceforge.net/users/ronys) know.

Finally, the graphics have been spruced up a bit - thanks to Emilijan
Mirceski for his patient work on the new logo and toolbar!

Bugs Fixed in 2.0:
==================
[871893] Saving a converted (from old format) database second time now
succeeds.
[875288,893513] Change safe combination works again.
[unreported] Find now selects items in tree view as well as list view.
[878768] Online help updated and functional.
[870756,886601] On XP, data would be invisible until minimize/maximize.
[862504,878768] The help file now works and is updated.
[895062,871893] Multiple saves after editing a converted (from old
format) database now work correctly.
[821837,777937] PasswordSafe is visible in taskbar and task switcher
even when only the login window is displayed.

New Features for 2.0pre2:
=========================
[RFE 504086] It is now possible to export the password database into a
plain ASCII file. Fields are separated by a tab character. Note that
this is a VERY large security risk if used carelessly.


Bugs Fixed in 2.0pre2:
======================
[859798, 859565] Debug libraries are no longer required.

- Export to v1.7 format fixed.

[777937] Safe combination dialog box now appears in taskbar and
switcher

New Features for 2.0pre1:
=========================
[RFE 782508, 829563, 815350, 555440] Tree, or heirarchical, view of
entries now supported. This allows the user to define categories,
sub-categories, etc.

Known Problems:
===============
[879400] A category cannot be dragged to the top level. Workaround:
Edit the Group field of the categories entries. For example, to make
category "b" a top level category instead of under "a", change all
its entries Group fields from "a.b" to "b".
