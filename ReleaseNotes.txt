==========================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with Password Safe version 1.91. For a short description of Password
Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more
information on the product and the project, please visit

New Features:
=============
[728507] Password Safe now remembers the last ten databases that were
opened, and displays them in the File drop-down menu.

[726583] Password Safe can now be set to be "always on top" via
options or system menu.

[726482] Password Safe now accepts the name of a database as an
optional command line arugement, opening the database instead of the
last one opened.

[726481] Title, username, notes and optionally the passwords (strongly
discouraged), are now displayed in the main window as separate
columns. It is possible to sort by a column by double-clicking the
column's name. Double-clicking the same column again will reverse the
order of the sort.

[726476] It is now possible to resize the main window. Password Safe
will remember the size and location of the last invocation.

fields except the password are scanned, case insensitive by
default. Invoke by Edit->Find Entry or via Ctrl-F.

[635048] The taskbar icons for "copy password" and "copy username"
have been replaced by something more clearly distinguishable. 

Bugs Fixed:
===========
[591882] It is now possible to copy via Ctrl-C from the Title,
Username and Notes fields in the Edit/View Entry window.

by default" option enabled.
