This is the Linux interface layer to the YubiKey API.
It depends on the following Yubico libraries:
yubico-c:                 https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-c.git
yubico-c-client:          https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-c-client.git
yubico-pam:               https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam.git
yubikey-personalization:  https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization.git

These libraries should be built and installed in the default
configuration as described in their respective READMEs.

Ultimately, the interface defined here will be made common to both
Windows and wx.
