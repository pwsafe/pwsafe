1. Introduction:
The Linux port of PasswordSafe is currently in BETA.
This means that (1) you should take care to keep copies of the
database to protect against possible loss of data due to bugs, and (2)
there are several unimplemented features. Nonetheless, we feel that
this is good enough to release as an early beta to gather feedback
from a wider audience.

2. Supported Distributions:
Currently Debian 8.0, Ubuntu 13.04 and Fedora 22 are supported, 32 and
64 bit systems. Slackware is independantly supported, see below.

3. Installation on Debian or Ubuntu:
3.1 Download the .deb file that corresponds to your distribution.
3.2 Install it using dpkg:
$ sudo dpkg -i passwordsafe-*.deb
Dpkg will complain if prerequisite packages are missing. To install
the missing packages:

4. Installation on Fedora:
