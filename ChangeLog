2007-02-26 [r1272]  arjun_acharya:

	* Summary: CMyTreeCtrl::OnEndLabelEdit has been modified to prevent
	  editing of group/entry names via click of mouse Detailed: If one
	  clicks Group/Entry with left mouse button, waits a bit, and
	  clicks again (i.e. NOT double click), one can edit the name of
	  group/entry, even in read-only mode. The change of code in this
	  commit prevents this from being done.

2007-02-25 [r1271]  arjun_acharya:

	* DK's drag&drop patch has made "MoveGroupToTopLevel" functionality
	  redundant. Therefore all traces of this have been removed from
	  the current revision. All that remains from additions in revision
	  1266 is the m_TreeViewGroup = _T("") addition to DboxMain::Delete

2007-02-24 [r1270]  ronys:

	* Minor tweaks to MoveGroupToTop - normalize error handling

2007-02-23 [r1266]  arjun_acharya:

	* 1)Implemented function "Move Group To Top Level" which allows,
	  upon right click of mouse button, for group (and all
	  sub-elements) to be returned to top level. 2)Also made minor
	  modification to DboxMain::Delete so that we have m_TreeViewGroup
	  = _T("") at end. Without this line, one encounters a few
	  problems. For example suppose you (in version 3, 6, 1, 1265)
	  A)you add Group as soon as app opens, via edit menu. This creates
	  "New Group" folder B)click on whitespace, then highlight "New
	  Group" and delete this via right click of mouse C)add group again
	  via edit. This time "New Group" gets opened within "New Group"
	  instead of top level

2007-02-21 [r1265]  ronys:

2003-04-23 [r67]  gconklin:

	* made the icons for copying password and username to the clipboard
	  more distinguishable

2003-04-21 [r66]  ronys:

	* Made CMYString::m_mystring a private member, in preparation of
	  moving away from ...

2003-04-21 [r65]  ronys:

	* Added description of v1.9 file format, updated note on MyCString

2003-04-17 [r64]  ronys:

	* Added my VisualC++ workspace and project files.

2003-04-15 [r63]  ronys:

	* First commit to project! - code cleanup (mainly changing
	  parameters to const references to avoid unnecessary object
	  creation) - Support password file passed as commandline argument,
	  with support for backward compat. - Fixed a minor bug with
	  constant being defined inconsistently. - Cleaned up Util.c (files
	  with this name end up being pretty messy...)

2002-04-24 [r60-61]  jrussell:

	* Remove obsolete modules, add ThisMfcApp

	* cosmetic change

2002-04-24 [r48-59]  jrussell:

	* Make the Mfc application object a separate module

	* Makefile for GNU make, running Visual C++ under Wine to build an
	  MFC app with a Linux host. Really, it works.

	* my debugging macros

	* this is now officially obsolete

	* code restructuring

	* Some code restructuring, mostly to find out what is obsolete or
	  static to the module

	* ThisMfcApp header

	* ThisMfcApp header, HtmlHelp

	* add header guards, remove MyString header -- try to make this
	  header necessary only for Mfc frontend

	* newline at EOF

	* ThisMfcApp header

	* ThisMfcApp header, get rid of 'not' macro

2002-04-24 [r47]  jrussell:

	* new font

2002-04-24 [r40-46]  jrussell:

	* Removed spurious English (Canada) properties, various dialog
	  tweaks, started removing obsoletes. This and resource.h are the
	  only things I'm currently using Visual Studio to edit.

	* Made this a global header file, separate from ThisMfcApp object.
	  This will make other frontends possible.

	* Add BlowFish header

	* Header fixes, HtmlHelp

	* Header fixes, C++ bools

	* Header fixes, code cleanup, C++ bools, HtmlHelp

	* ThisMfcApp header, HtmlHelp

	* cosmetic changes

	* header fix

	* cosmetic change to header guard

	* ThisMfcApp header

	* remove obsolete member, start using C++ bools

	* Started paring away obsolete code, restructuring things

	* MyString header

	* ThisMfcApp header, HtmlHelp

2002-04-24 [r28-30]  jrussell:

	* ThisMfcApp header

	* code cleanup

	* ThisMfcApp header, HtmlHelp

2002-04-15 [r27]  jrussell:

	* fix EOLs

2002-04-15 [r26]  jrussell:

	* fix EOLs

2001-12-14 [r24-25]  jrussell:

	* New object, PwsBackend, is intended to be the non-UI app context,
	  which will allow other front ends besides the MFC one. Purely
	  skeletal at this point.

	* Added code to accept Drag-n-Drop file drops. Doesn't do anything
	  but pop up a MessageBox yet.

2001-12-12 [r21-23]  jrussell:

	* This is automatically updated when I edit the .rc in Visual
	  Studio. I may have temporarily broken things in here, and will
	  need to tweak it a bit. Caveat coder.

	* Added include for HtmlHelp

	* Added "Create" button to initial passkey entry dialog. (Note that
	  this is the only file I'm using Visual Studio to edit, and even
	  so, I do edit it by hand from time to time.)

2001-12-12 [r20]  jrussell:

	* Start adding hooks to HtmlHelp, plus some comments to help me
	  figure things out. Started marking code with WITH_BACKEND for
	  when I split off the backend (non-UI) code.

2001-12-12 [r17-19]  jrussell:

	* Add "Create New Database" button and code to handle it. Part of
	  the bug #3 fix.

	* Add htmlhelp.lib to link

	* Fixes for bug #3 (allow database switch if current can't be
	  opened) and #8 (PgUp/PgDn didn't work)

2001-12-06 [r16]  jrussell:

	* Preliminary skeletal code for some new objects -- if we're only
	  going to use MFC for the UI, then CString and CList have to go

2001-12-06 [r13-15]  jrussell:

	* More binary resources added

	* Renamed

	* Adding binary resource files

2001-12-06 [r9-12]  jrussell:

	* Interim checkin after a few days hacking

	* Renamed to Makefile.w32

	* Renamed to DboxMain.h

	* Renamed to DboxMain.cpp

2001-12-04 [r8]  jrussell:

	* Just starting to comment things as I begin to understand them

	* Initial revision
